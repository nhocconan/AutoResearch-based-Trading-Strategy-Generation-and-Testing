"""
Hypothesis: 4h Camarilla R3/S3 breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume confirmation.
- Long when price breaks above Camarilla R3 and close > 1d EMA34 (bullish trend)
- Short when price breaks below Camarilla S3 and close < 1d EMA34 (bearish trend)
- Volume must be > 1.8x 20-period average for conviction
- ATR-based trailing stop: exit long when price drops 2.0x ATR from highest high since entry
- ATR-based trailing stop: exit short when price rises 2.0x ATR from lowest low since entry
- Uses 1d HTF for trend filter (more stable than 12h) to reduce whipsaw
- Target: 75-200 total trades over 4 years (19-50/year) to minimize fee drag
- Designed to work in both bull and bear markets via trend filter and breakout structure
