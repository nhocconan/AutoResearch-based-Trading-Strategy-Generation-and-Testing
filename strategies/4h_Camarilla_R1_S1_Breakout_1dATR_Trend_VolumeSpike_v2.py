4h_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_1dATR_Trend_VolumeSpike_v2
Hypothesis: Trade 4h Camarilla R1/S1 breakouts with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume spike confirmation. 
Camarilla R1/S1 provide daily support/resistance levels. In bull markets: buy when price breaks above R1 and price > 1d EMA34. 
In bear markets: sell when price breaks below S1 and price < 1d EMA34. 
Requires volume > 2.0x 20-period average for confirmation to avoid false breakouts (tighter than v1). 
Exit on opposite Camarilla level touch or trend reversal. 
Position size: 0.25 to balance reward and risk and reduce fee churn. 
Target: 60-120 total trades over 4 years = 15-30/year (reduced from v1 to avoid overtrading). 
Uses 1d HTF for more stable trend alignment vs 12h in v1, which should improve performance in both bull and bear markets.
