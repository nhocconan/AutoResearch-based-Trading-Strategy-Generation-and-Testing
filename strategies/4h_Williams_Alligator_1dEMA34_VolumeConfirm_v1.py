# Hypothesis: 4h Williams Alligator with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume confirmation
# Uses Williams Alligator (jaw/teeth/lips) to identify trendless markets and avoid false breakouts
# 1d EMA34 provides strong HTF trend filter to align with primary trend direction
# Volume spike (2.0x 20-period average) confirms breakout validity with institutional participation
# ATR-based trailing stop (2.5x ATR) manages risk while allowing trends to develop
# Designed for low trade frequency (target: 15-30 trades/year) to minimize fee drag
# Works in bull markets via long signals when lips > teeth > jaw and price > 1d EMA34
# Works in bear markets via short signals when lips < teeth < jaw and price < 1d EMA34
# Williams Alligator excels in ranging markets by staying flat, reducing whipsaw losses
