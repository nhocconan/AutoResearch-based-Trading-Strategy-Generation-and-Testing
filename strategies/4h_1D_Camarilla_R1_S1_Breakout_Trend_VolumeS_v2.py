# 4h_1D_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_Trend_VolumeS_v2
# Hypothesis: Enhanced version with stricter entry conditions (volume spike multiplier) and tighter exits to reduce trade frequency. Maintains the core logic of trading breakouts from daily Camarilla R1/S1 levels in the direction of the daily trend, but with volume confirmation requiring 1.5x average volume to filter out weak breakouts. Aims for 50-150 total trades over 4 years to avoid fee drag while maintaining edge in both bull and bear markets by following higher-timeframe trend.
