# 4h_1D_VolumeSpike_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout
# Hypothesis: Breakouts from Camarilla R1/S1 levels on daily timeframe, confirmed by volume spikes and aligned with 1d trend (price > EMA34 on daily).
# Works in bull markets via breakout continuation and in bear markets via mean-reversion from extremes (short at S1, long at R1).
# Uses daily timeframe for structure and trend, 4h for execution to limit trade frequency.
