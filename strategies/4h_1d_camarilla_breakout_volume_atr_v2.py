# Hypothesis: 4h Camarilla pivot breakout with 1d volume confirmation and ATR trailing stop
# - Uses 1d HTF for prior day's Camarilla pivot levels (H3/L3) and volume average
# - Long when price closes above H3 with 4h volume > 1.2x 20-period 1d average volume (scaled to 4h)
# - Short when price closes below L3 with same volume confirmation
# - ATR(14) trailing stop: exit long at 2.0x ATR below highest high since entry
# - Fixed position size 0.25 to control drawdown
# - Target: 20-50 trades/year on 4h timeframe (80-200 total over 4 years)
# - Camarilla levels provide strong support/resistance; volume confirms breakout validity
# - Works in both bull and bear markets by capturing institutional breakout attempts
