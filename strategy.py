4h_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_1dTrend_Volume_S
Hypothesis: Price breaking above Camarilla R1 level indicates bullish momentum; breaking below S1 indicates bearish momentum. 
Filter trades to align with daily EMA trend and require volume spikes to avoid false breakouts. 
This strategy targets 20-40 trades per year by combining price structure (Camarilla), trend filter (daily EMA), and volume confirmation.
Works in bull markets by capturing breakouts and in bear markets by shorting breakdowns with trend alignment.
