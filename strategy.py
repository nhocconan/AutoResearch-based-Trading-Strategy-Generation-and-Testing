4h_1d_Camarilla_Pivot_R1S1_Breakout_Volume
Hypothesis: Uses daily Camarilla pivot levels R1/S1 as entry triggers with volume confirmation.
In bull markets, buy R1 breakouts; in bear markets, short S1 breakdowns. Volume filter reduces
false signals. Targets 20-30 trades/year to minimize fee drag. Works in both regimes by
trading breakouts of key daily support/resistance levels.
