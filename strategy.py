# 1d_PivotPoint_Breakout_1wTrend
# Hypothesis: Use weekly pivot points from the prior week to identify key support/resistance.
# Long when price breaks above weekly R1 with volume spike and 1w EMA50 uptrend.
# Short when price breaks below weekly S1 with volume spike and 1w EMA50 downtrend.
# Exit on mean reversion to weekly pivot (PP). Weekly pivots reset every week, providing
# fresh levels that adapt to market regime. Designed for low turnover (~10-20/year) to avoid fee drag.
# Weekly timeframe captures broader market trend, reducing whipsaw.
