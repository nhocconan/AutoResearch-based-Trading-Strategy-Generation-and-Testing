# Hypothesis: 4h Camarilla R3/S3 breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume confirmation (>2.0x 20 EMA volume)
# Uses 4h Camarilla pivot levels (R3/S3) for structure - captures strong momentum bursts at key support/resistance
# 1d EMA34 ensures alignment with higher timeframe trend to avoid counter-trend whipsaws in bear markets
# Volume confirmation filters false breakouts (>2.0x average volume) - tighter to reduce trades
# Discrete sizing 0.25 minimizes fee churn while maintaining profitability
# Target: 75-200 total trades over 4 years = 19-50/year for 4h timeframe
# Works in bull markets (continuation at upper channel) and bear markets (continuation at lower channel)
# Focus on BTC/ETH by requiring 1d trend alignment (avoids SOL-only bias)
