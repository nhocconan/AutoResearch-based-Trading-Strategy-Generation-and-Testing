12h_1d_camarilla_breakout_volume_v1
Strategy: 12h breakout with 1d volume confirmation and close-based stoploss
Timeframe: 12h
Leverage: 1.0
Hypothesis: Buy when 12h closes above prior 1d R3 with volume expansion; sell when 12h closes below prior 1d S3 with volume expansion. Exit when price returns to prior 1d pivot. Uses volume to confirm breakouts and pivot for mean-reversion exit. Designed for both bull and bear markets by trading breakouts from daily ranges, which capture momentum in trending markets and reversals in ranging markets. Low-frequency design targets 15-25 trades/year to minimize fee drag.
