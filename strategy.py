# 12h_1w_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_Trend_Volume
# Hypothesis: 12h breakout from weekly Camarilla R1/S1 levels with daily EMA34 trend filter and volume confirmation.
# Weekly Camarilla levels provide strong institutional support/resistance, daily EMA34 filters trend bias,
# and volume surge avoids false breakouts. Designed for low trade frequency (12-37/year) to minimize fee drag.
# Works in bull markets (breakouts with trend) and bear markets (breakouts against trend filtered by EMA).
