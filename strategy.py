# Hypothesis: 12h Camarilla pivot breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume confirmation.
# Enter long when price breaks above Camarilla R3 level, 1d EMA34 trending up, and volume > 2.0x 20-bar average.
# Enter short when price breaks below Camarilla S3 level, 1d EMA34 trending down, and volume > 2.0x 20-bar average.
# Exit when price returns to Camarilla Pivot level (midpoint).
# Uses discrete position sizing (0.25) to limit drawdown in bear markets like 2022.
# Target: 50-150 total trades over 4 years (12-37/year) to minimize fee drag.
# Camarilla levels identify key support/resistance; 1d EMA34 ensures alignment with higher timeframe trend;
# high volume threshold confirms institutional participation. Works in both bull (breakouts) and bear (breakdowns).
