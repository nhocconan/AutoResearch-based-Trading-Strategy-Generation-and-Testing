12h_Camarilla_R3_S3_Breakout_1dTrend_Volume
Hypothesis: Camarilla pivot breakouts with 1-day trend filter and volume confirmation capture strong moves in both bull and bear markets.
Designed for low trade frequency (15-30/year) with clear entry/exit rules to minimize fee drag.
Works by buying strength in uptrends and selling weakness in downtrends, avoiding choppy markets.
