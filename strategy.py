4h_Camarilla_R1S1_Breakout_1dTrend_Volume
Hypothesis: Price breaking above/below Camarilla R1/S1 levels (from daily) with daily trend filter (price > EMA34) and volume spike (2x average). Camarilla levels act as intraday support/resistance; breaks with trend and volume indicate strong moves. Target 20-40 trades/year to avoid fee drag. Works in bull/bear via trend filter.
