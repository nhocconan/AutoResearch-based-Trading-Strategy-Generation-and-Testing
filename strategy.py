# Hypothesis: 12h Williams Fractal breakout + 1d EMA34 trend + volume confirmation
# Williams Fractals identify swing highs/lows with confirmation delay.
# Breakouts above recent bearish fractal (sell fractal) or below bullish fractal (buy fractal)
# with 1d EMA34 trend alignment and volume spike capture sustained moves.
# Designed for 50-150 total trades over 4 years (12-37/year) on 12h timeframe.
# Works in bull markets via upward breaks and in bear markets via downward breaks.
