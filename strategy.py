# 6H_Camarilla_R3S3_Breakout_1dTrend_Volume
# Hypothesis: Camarilla R3/S3 breakouts on 6h filtered by 1d trend and volume spikes.
# R3/S3 levels represent stronger support/resistance than R1/S1, reducing false breakouts.
# Trend filter uses 1-day EMA34 to ensure alignment with higher timeframe momentum.
# Volume confirmation requires >2x 20-period average to confirm institutional participation.
# Works in bull/bear by following 1d trend direction; avoids range-bound whipsaws.
# Target: 12-37 trades/year per symbol (50-150 total over 4 years) to minimize fee drag.
