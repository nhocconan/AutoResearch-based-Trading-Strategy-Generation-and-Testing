12h_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_1wTrend_Volume
Hypothesis: Camarilla R1/S1 breakouts with weekly trend filter and volume confirmation capture breakouts in both bull and bear markets. Uses 12h timeframe to minimize trade frequency and maximize signal quality, with weekly trend filter to avoid counter-trend trades in bear markets. Designed for 15-30 trades/year with strong breakout logic and volume confirmation.
