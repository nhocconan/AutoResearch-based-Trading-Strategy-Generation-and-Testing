# Hypothesis: 12h Camarilla R3/S3 breakout with 1w EMA34 trend filter and volume confirmation.
# Long when price breaks above Camarilla R3 with 1w uptrend (price > 1w EMA34) and volume spike (>1.8x 20-bar avg).
# Short when price breaks below Camarilla S3 with 1w downtrend (price < 1w EMA34) and volume spike.
# Exit on opposite Camarilla level (R3/S3) touch for mean reversion.
# Uses proven Camarilla structure with strict volume confirmation to limit trades (target 50-150 total trades over 4 years).
# 12h timeframe reduces fee drag while capturing medium-term trends; 1w EMA filter ensures alignment with major trend.
# Works in both bull (trend following) and bear (mean reversion within channel) markets.
