1d_1w_KAMA_Trend_Filter
Hypothesis: On daily chart, KAMA adapts to market noise - in trending markets it tracks price closely,
in ranging markets it lags. Combined with 1-week trend filter (EMA50) and volume confirmation,
this captures strong trends while avoiding whipsaws in ranging markets. Weekly trend filter
reduces trades in counter-trend periods, improving win rate in both bull and bear markets.
Position size 0.25 targets 10-25 trades/year to minimize fee drag.
