# Hypothesis: 6h Williams Fractal breakout with weekly EMA50 trend filter and volume confirmation
# Williams fractals identify significant swing highs/lows that act as support/resistance
# Breakouts above bearish fractals or below bullish fractals with volume indicate strong momentum
# Weekly EMA50 ensures trades align with long-term trend to reduce false signals in ranging markets
# Volume confirmation at 2.0x average filters low-participation moves
# Target: 50-150 total trades over 4 years (12-37/year) for 6h timeframe
# Discrete sizing 0.25 to balance profit potential and fee drag
# Works in both bull and bear markets by following the weekly trend with momentum confirmation
