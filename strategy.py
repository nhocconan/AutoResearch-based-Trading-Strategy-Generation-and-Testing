# Hypothesis: 4h Camarilla R3/S3 breakout with 1d trend filter (EMA34) and volume confirmation
# Long when price breaks above R3 level with 1d bullish trend (close > EMA34) and volume > 2.0x 20-period volume EMA
# Short when price breaks below S3 level with 1d bearish trend (close < EMA34) and volume > 2.0x 20-period volume EMA
# Uses 1d EMA34 for major trend filter to reduce whipsaw in bear markets, targeting 20-50 trades/year on 4h.
# High volume threshold (2.0x) reduces overtrading. Camarilla pivot levels provide institutional structure.
# Works in bull markets via longs in bullish 1d trend regime and bear markets via shorts in bearish 1d trend regime.
