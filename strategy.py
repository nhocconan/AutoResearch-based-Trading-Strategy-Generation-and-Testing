# Hypothesis: 1d Donchian(20) breakout with 1w EMA50 trend filter and volume confirmation
# Uses weekly EMA50 to filter trend direction and daily Donchian channels for breakout signals.
# Enters long when price breaks above 20-day high with volume confirmation and weekly uptrend.
# Enters short when price breaks below 20-day low with volume confirmation and weekly downtrend.
# Designed for 7-25 trades/year (~30-100 total over 4 years) to minimize fee drag.
# Weekly EMA50 provides strong trend filter, Donchian channels give clear breakout levels,
# volume confirmation reduces false breakouts. Works in both bull and bear markets.
