# Hypothesis: 6h Williams %R with 1d trend filter and volume confirmation.
# Williams %R measures momentum and overbought/oversold conditions.
# Long when Williams %R crosses above -20 (from oversold) with bullish 1d trend and volume spike.
# Short when Williams %R crosses below -80 (from overbought) with bearish 1d trend and volume spike.
# Exit when Williams %R returns to -50 (mean reversion).
# Uses 1d timeframe for trend filter to reduce noise and improve win rate in both bull and bear markets.
# Williams %R is effective in ranging markets (common in 2025+) and captures reversals in trends.
# Target: 12-37 trades/year (50-150 over 4 years) to minimize fee drag.
