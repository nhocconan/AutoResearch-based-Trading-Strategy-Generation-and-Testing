6h_Camarilla_R4_S4_Breakout_1dTrend
Hypothesis: Camarilla pivot levels on 1d timeframe act as strong support/resistance. 
Breakouts above R4 or below S4 with volume confirmation and aligned 1d trend (close > EMA34) 
signal strong momentum continuation. Uses 0.25 position size to balance risk/return and 
limit trade frequency (~15-30/year) to minimize fee drag in 6-hour bars.
Works in bull markets via breakout continuation and in bear markets via breakdown continuation.
