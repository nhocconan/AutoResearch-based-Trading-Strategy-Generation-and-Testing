1d_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_1wTrend_VolumeSpike
Hypothesis: Camarilla R1/S1 breakout on 1d with volume spike (>2x 20-median) and 1w EMA50 trend filter.
R1/S1 provide early breakout signals with tighter stops. Volume spike confirms institutional interest.
1w EMA50 filter ensures we only trade in the direction of the weekly trend, avoiding counter-trend whipsaws.
Discrete sizing (0.25) minimizes fee drag. Target: 30-100 trades over 4 years. Works in bull via breakout
continuation and in bear by avoiding counter-trend trades via weekly EMA filter.
