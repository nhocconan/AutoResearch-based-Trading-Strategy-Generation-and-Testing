# Hypothesis: 6h Camarilla pivot breakout with 1d volume confirmation
# - Camarilla levels from 1d OHLC: R3/S3 for mean reversion fade, R4/S4 for breakout continuation
# - Long when price breaks above R4 with 1d volume > 1.5x 20-period average
# - Short when price breaks below S4 with 1d volume > 1.5x 20-period average
# - Exit when price returns to 1d close (pivot) or opposite Camarilla level (R3/S3) with volume
# - Uses discrete position sizing 0.25 to limit fee churn
# - Target: 12-37 trades/year on 6h timeframe (50-150 total over 4 years)
# - Works in both bull/bear via Camarilla's adaptive levels based on prior day's range
