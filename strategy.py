# Hypothesis: 4h Donchian(20) breakout with 1d EMA50 trend filter and volume confirmation (>1.5x 20 EMA volume)
# Uses Donchian channel from prior completed 1d bar for structure (breakout at upper/lower band = momentum)
# 1d EMA50 filter ensures we trade in direction of higher timeframe trend (avoids counter-trend whipsaws)
# Volume confirmation ensures breakout has sufficient participation (>1.5x average volume)
# Discrete sizing 0.25 balances risk and return while minimizing fee churn
# Target: 75-200 total trades over 4 years = 19-50/year for 4h timeframe
# Works in both bull (breakout continuation) and bear (breakdown continuation) markets
# Focus on BTC/ETH by requiring 1d trend alignment (avoids SOL-only bias, more robust across regimes)
