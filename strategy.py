6h Williams Fractal Breakout + 1d EMA34 Trend + Volume Spike
Hypothesis: Williams Fractals identify potential swing points. A bullish fractal (low with two higher lows on each side)
breakout above its high in an uptrend (price > 1d EMA34) with volume spike signals buying momentum.
Conversely, a bearish fractal (high with two lower highs on each side) breakout below its low in a downtrend
(price < 1d EMA34) with volume spike signals selling pressure. This captures breakouts from significant swing points
with trend alignment and institutional participation, working in both bull (buy breakouts in uptrend) and 
bear (sell breakdowns in downtrend) markets. 6h timeframe targets 12-37 trades/year (50-150 over 4 years).
