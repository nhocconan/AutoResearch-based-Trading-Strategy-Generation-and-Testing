12h Camarilla H3L3 Breakout with 1d EMA34 Trend and Volume Spike
Hypothesis: Camarilla pivot levels (H3/L3) act as strong intraday support/resistance on 12h timeframe. 
Breakouts above H3 or below L3 with volume confirmation and aligned 1d EMA34 trend capture institutional moves. 
The 1d EMA34 ensures we trade with higher timeframe momentum, reducing false breakouts. Volume spike confirms 
participation. Designed for low trade frequency (12-37/year) on 12h timeframe to work in both bull and bear markets 
via trend following. Uses discrete position sizing (0.25) to minimize fee churn.
