# 4h_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_1dTrend_VolumeS
# Hypothesis: Breakout above Camarilla R1 or below S1 from daily pivot, filtered by 1d EMA34 trend and volume confirmation (2x 20-period avg). Exit on opposite touch of S1/R1 to reduce whipsaw. Uses tighter entry (R1/S1 instead of R3/S3) with stronger trend filter to capture swings in both bull and bear markets while limiting trades to 20-40/year.
