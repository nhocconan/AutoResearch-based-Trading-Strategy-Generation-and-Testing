# Hypothesis: Daily Donchian(20) breakouts with weekly EMA50 trend filter and volume spike
# captures institutional breakouts in both bull and bear markets. Weekly trend filter ensures
# we trade with the higher timeframe trend, reducing whipsaws. Volume confirmation adds
# conviction. Position size of 0.25 manages drawdown, and 10-day cooldown prevents overtrading.
# Target: 15-25 trades per year (60-100 total over 4 years) to minimize fee drag.
# Works in bull markets (trend following breakouts) and bear markets (short breakdowns).
