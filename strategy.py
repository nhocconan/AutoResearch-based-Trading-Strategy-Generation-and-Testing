4h_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_1dTrend
Hypothesis: Camarilla R1/S1 levels from daily timeframe provide high-probability breakout zones.
Breakouts above R1 or below S1 with volume confirmation and aligned daily trend (close > EMA34) 
signal momentum continuation. Uses 0.30 position size for balanced risk/return.
Target: 20-40 trades/year on 4h timeframe to minimize fee drag while capturing strong moves.
Works in bull markets via breakout continuation and in bear markets via breakdown continuation.
