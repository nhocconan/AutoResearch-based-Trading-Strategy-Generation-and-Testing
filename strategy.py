# Hypothesis: 12h Camarilla H3/L3 breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume spike (>2.0x average)
# Uses 12h primary timeframe to reduce trade frequency and fee drag. Camarilla levels from daily timeframe
# provide institutional support/resistance. Trend filter ensures alignment with daily momentum.
# Discrete sizing 0.25 minimizes fee churn. Target: 50-150 trades over 4 years (12-37/year).
# Works in both bull and bear markets by following daily trend while using volume confirmation
# to avoid false breakouts.
