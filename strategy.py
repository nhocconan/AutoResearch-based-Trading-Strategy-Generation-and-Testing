# The strategy is based on the observation that price often reacts to key intraday levels derived from the previous day's high, low, and close.
# It uses the Camarilla equation to calculate these levels on the daily timeframe.
# The strategy goes long when the price breaks above the R3 level with confirmation from a 1-day uptrend (price > EMA34) and a volume spike.
# It goes short when the price breaks below the S3 level with confirmation from a 1-day downtrend (price < EMA34) and a volume spike.
# Exits are triggered when the price crosses back through the EMA34 level or breaks the opposing S1/R1 level.
# This approach aims to capture momentum moves from key daily support/resistance levels while filtering for trend and institutional participation.
# The 6h timeframe is used to balance signal frequency and noise reduction, targeting 12-37 trades per year.
