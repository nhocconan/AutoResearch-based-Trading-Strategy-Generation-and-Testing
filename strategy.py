6h_Camarilla_R3_S3_Breakout_1wTrend_VolumeSpike_v2
Hypothesis: 6h Camarilla pivot R3/S3 breakout with 1-week EMA34 trend filter and volume spike confirmation.
Only takes breakouts in direction of 1-week trend to avoid counter-trend whipsaws.
Uses discrete position sizing (0.25) and includes a minimum holding period of 3 bars to reduce churn.
Designed for 12-37 trades/year (50-150 over 4 years) by requiring confluence of breakout, trend, and volume.
Works in bull/bear via 1w trend filter: only takes long breakouts in uptrend, short in downtrend.
