1h_4h_1d_Camarilla_R3_S3_Breakout_TrendVol_v1
Hypothesis: 1-hour breakouts from 4-hour Camarilla R3/S3 levels with 1-day trend filter and volume spike confirmation.
Uses 4h/1d for signal direction (trend and levels), 1h only for entry timing precision.
Targets 1h timeframe with reduced trade frequency via multi-timeframe confluence and session filter (08-20 UTC).
Designed to work in both bull and bear markets via 1d trend filter and volume confirmation to avoid false breakouts.
Focuses on stronger breakout levels (R3/S3) for higher quality signals.
