# Hypothesis: Weekly trend filter (EMA50) + Camarilla R3/S3 breakouts with volume confirmation on 12h timeframe
# will capture strong institutional moves in both bull and bear markets. Weekly trend ensures we trade
# with the dominant market direction, reducing false breakouts. Volume filter ensures institutional participation.
# Cooldown of 4 bars (48 hours) and volume threshold of 2.0x average target 15-25 trades per year.
# Position size of 0.25 manages drawdown during volatile periods. Works in bull (breakouts above R3 in uptrend)
# and bear (breakdowns below S3 in downtrend) by trading with weekly trend.
