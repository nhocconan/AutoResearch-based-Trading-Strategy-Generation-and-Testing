# 4h_Camarilla_R1S1_Breakout_1dTrend_VolumeS
# Hypothesis: Camarilla pivot levels (R1/S1) from 1d timeframe combined with 1d trend filter and volume confirmation. 
# Long when price breaks above R1 with 1d uptrend and volume confirmation. Short when price breaks below S1 with 1d downtrend and volume confirmation. 
# Camarilla levels provide significant support/resistance where price often reverses or breaks out with momentum. 
# The 1d trend filter ensures we trade in the direction of higher timeframe momentum, reducing false signals. 
# Volume confirmation ensures breakouts have institutional participation. Designed for 4h timeframe to balance trade frequency and signal quality.
