12h_Camarilla_R3_S3_Breakout_1dTrend_Volume
Hypothesis: Camarilla pivot levels from 1d provide strong intraday support/resistance.
Breakout above R3 or below S3 with 1d trend filter and volume confirmation indicates
institutional participation. Designed for low trade frequency (<30/year) to minimize
fee drag. Works in both bull and bear regimes by following breakouts with volume.
