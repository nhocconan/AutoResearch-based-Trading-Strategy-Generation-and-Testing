# Hypothesis: Camarilla R3/S3 breakout on 6H with volume confirmation and daily trend filter.
# Uses wider bands (R3/S3) for fewer, higher-quality breaks vs R1/S1. Works in bull markets 
# (breakouts continue) and bear markets (mean reversion at opposite level). Daily EMA34 ensures 
# alignment with longer-term trend, reducing counter-trend trades. Volume spike filter (1.5x 
# 20-day average) ensures momentum confirmation. Target: 15-30 trades/year to minimize fee decay 
# while capturing significant moves. Avoids overtrading by using wider bands and strict conditions.
