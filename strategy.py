"""
Hypothesis: 4h Camarilla R1/S1 breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume spike confirmation.
- Primary timeframe: 4h targeting 75-200 total trades over 4 years (19-50/year).
- HTF: 1d for EMA34 trend filter and Camarilla pivot levels (from previous day).
- Entry: Long when price breaks above R1 with volume spike AND close > 1d EMA34.
         Short when price breaks below S1 with volume spike AND close < 1d EMA34.
- Exit: Opposite breakout (price crosses S1 for longs, R1 for shorts) OR trend filter fails.
- Signal size: 0.25 discrete to minimize fee drag while maintaining profit potential.
- Camarilla levels provide statistically significant intraday support/resistance.
- Volume spike confirms institutional participation.
- Works in bull markets (buy breakouts in uptrend) and bear markets (sell breakdowns in downtrend).
- Estimated trades: ~100 total over 4 years (~25/year) based on breakout frequency with filters.
