# Hypothesis: 4h Williams Fractal Breakout with 1d EMA34 Trend Filter and Volume Confirmation
# Uses Williams fractals from 1d timeframe for structure, 1d EMA34 for trend filter
# Entry: Bullish fractal breakout above recent high in uptrend (price > 1d EMA34) with volume spike
#        Bearish fractal breakdown below recent low in downtrend (price < 1d EMA34) with volume spike
# Exit: Close crosses 1d EMA34 (trend change) or opposite fractal touch
# Target: 75-200 total trades over 4 years (19-50/year) for 4h timeframe
# Discrete sizing 0.25 balances profit potential and fee drag
# Works in both bull and bear markets by trading with the 1d trend
