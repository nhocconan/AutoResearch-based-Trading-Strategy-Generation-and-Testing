# Hypothesis: Breakout at 1d Camarilla R3/S3 with volume spike and 1d trend filter works in both bull and bear markets.
# In bull markets: 1d trend up, breakouts above R3 capture continuation.
# In bear markets: 1d trend down, breakdowns below S3 capture continuation.
# Volume spike confirms institutional participation. 4h timeframe balances signal quality and trade frequency.
# Target: 75-200 total trades over 4 years (19-50/year) to avoid fee drag.
