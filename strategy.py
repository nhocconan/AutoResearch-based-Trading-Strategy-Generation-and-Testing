"""
Hypothesis: 4-hour Williams Fractal Breakout with 1-day EMA trend filter and volume confirmation.
Trades breakouts of daily Williams Fractal levels in the direction of the daily EMA trend.
Uses volume spike to confirm breakout strength. Designed for low trade frequency (20-50 trades/year)
to minimize fee drag and work in both bull and bear markets by aligning with higher timeframe trend
and using breakout logic (momentum) rather than mean-reversion.
