# Hypothesis: Camarilla R1/S1 breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume confirmation on 4h timeframe.
# Long when price breaks above R1 with volume spike in 1d uptrend.
# Short when price breaks below S1 with volume spike in 1d downtrend.
# Exits when price returns to S1/R1 or trend changes.
# Uses 1d EMA34 for trend filter to ensure alignment with higher timeframe momentum.
# Volume confirmation avoids false breakouts. Cooldown (1 day) reduces trade frequency.
# Target: 20-40 trades/year. Works in bull markets by catching breakouts in uptrends
# and in bear markets by shorting breakdowns in downtrends. 4h timeframe balances 
# signal quality and trade frequency. Camarilla levels provide precise intraday
# support/resistance derived from prior day's range.
