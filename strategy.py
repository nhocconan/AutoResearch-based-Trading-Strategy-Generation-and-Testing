# Hypothesis: 1d Camarilla pivot breakout with 1w trend filter and volume confirmation
# - Uses 1d Camarilla pivot levels (H3/L3) for mean reversion entries in ranging markets
# - 1w EMA(21) trend filter: only take long when price > EMA, short when price < EMA
# - Volume confirmation: 1d volume > 1.5x 20-period average to ensure breakout strength
# - ATR-based trailing stop at 2.0x ATR from extreme for risk control
# - Position size: 0.25 (25% of capital) - discrete level to minimize fee churn
# - Target: ~10-25 trades/year (40-100 total over 4 years) per 1d strategy guidelines
# - Novelty: Combines Camarilla pivot mean reversion with weekly trend filter to avoid
#   trading against the higher timeframe trend, reducing whipsaws in both bull/bear markets
