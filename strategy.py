12h_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_1dTrend_VolumeSpike
Hypothesis: Camarilla pivot breakout on 12h with 1d trend filter and volume spike provides high-probability directional moves in both bull and bear markets.
Long when price breaks above R1 + price > 1d EMA50 + volume spike (>1.5x 20-period avg).
Short when price breaks below S1 + price < 1d EMA50 + volume spike.
Exit when price reverses to touch opposite S1/R1 or trend changes.
Designed for low trade frequency (15-30/year) to minimize fee flood while capturing strong trends.
