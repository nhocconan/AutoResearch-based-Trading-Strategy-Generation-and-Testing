1d_1w_camarilla_pivot_volume_v1
Strategy: Daily Camarilla pivot breakout with volume confirmation and weekly trend filter
Timeframe: 1d
Leverage: 1.0
Hypothesis: Uses daily Camarilla pivot levels (H3/L3) for breakout entries confirmed by volume spike (>1.5x average volume) and filtered by weekly EMA20 trend direction. Designed to capture strong momentum moves in trending markets while avoiding false breakouts in chop. Works in bull markets (breakouts with trend) and bear markets (breakouts against trend filtered out). Target: 30-100 total trades over 4 years.
