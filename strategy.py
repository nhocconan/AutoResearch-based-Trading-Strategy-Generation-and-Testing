4h_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_1dTrend_Volume_Spike
Hypothesis: Combines Camarilla pivot breakout with 1-day trend filter and volume spike to capture high-probability moves.
Works in bull/bear by requiring trend alignment and volume confirmation, reducing false breakouts.
Target: 20-50 trades per year on 4h timeframe.
