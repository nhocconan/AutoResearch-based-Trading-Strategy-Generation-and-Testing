# 6h_donchian_weekly_pivot_volume_v1
# Hypothesis: 6h strategy using Donchian(20) breakout aligned with weekly pivot direction.
# Long when price breaks above 6h Donchian(20) high AND weekly bias is bullish (price > weekly pivot).
# Short when price breaks below 6h Donchian(20) low AND weekly bias is bearish (price < weekly pivot).
# Volume confirmation: current volume > 1.3x 20-period average to filter weak breakouts.
# Exit when price returns to the 6h Donchian(20) midpoint (mean reversion) or opposite breakout occurs.
# Uses discrete position sizing (0.25) to minimize fee churn.
# Designed to capture strong breakouts in both bull and bear markets while avoiding false signals in ranging markets.
# Target: 12-37 trades/year (50-150 total over 4 years) on BTC/ETH/SOL.
