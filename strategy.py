# Hypothesis: 12h strategy using 1d Camarilla pivot levels + volume confirmation + ATR stoploss
# - Uses 1d HTF for Camarilla pivot levels (H3/L3) to identify key support/resistance
# - Long when price breaks above 1d Camarilla H3 level with volume > 1.5x 20-period average
# - Short when price breaks below 1d Camarilla L3 level with volume > 1.5x 20-period average
# - ATR(14) trailing stop: exit long at 2.5x ATR below highest high since entry, exit short at 2.5x ATR above lowest low since entry
# - Fixed position size 0.25 to control drawdown
# - Camarilla levels work in all regimes: act as magnet levels in range, breakout points in trend
# - Volume confirmation filters false breakouts
# - Target: 12-37 trades/year on 12h timeframe (50-150 total over 4 years)
