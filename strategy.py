# Hypothesis: 4h Donchian(20) breakout with 1d trend filter and volume confirmation
# - Long when price breaks above Donchian(20) high with volume > 1.5x 20-bar average AND 1d close > 1d EMA50
# - Short when price breaks below Donchian(20) low with volume > 1.5x 20-bar average AND 1d close < 1d EMA50
# - Exit when price retraces to Donchian(20) midpoint OR volume drops below 0.7x average
# - Uses 1d EMA50 trend filter to avoid counter-trend trades in bear markets (2025+)
# - Tight volume thresholds (1.5x spike, 0.7x weak) target 20-40 trades/year
# - Focus on BTC/ETH; proven pattern from DB top performers
