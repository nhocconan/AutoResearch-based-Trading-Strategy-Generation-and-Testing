# 12h_1W_Camarilla_R3S3_Breakout_Volume_Trend
# Hypothesis: 12-hour breakouts above weekly R3 or below weekly S3 with volume confirmation and weekly trend filter.
# Uses weekly timeframe for trend and pivot levels to reduce noise and avoid overtrading. Designed for 12-37 trades/year.
# Weekly trend filter avoids whipsaws in range markets; volume confirms institutional interest.
# Works in bull markets (breakouts continue) and bear markets (breakdowns continue) by following the weekly trend.
