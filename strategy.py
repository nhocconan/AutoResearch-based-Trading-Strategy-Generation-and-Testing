# Hypothesis: 4h Camarilla R1/S1 breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume confirmation
# Long when price breaks above Camarilla R1 level AND price > 1d EMA34 (uptrend) AND volume > 1.5 * 20-period avg volume
# Short when price breaks below Camarilla S1 level AND price < 1d EMA34 (downtrend) AND volume > 1.5 * 20-period avg volume
# Exit with ATR-based trailing stop: signal→0 when long and price < highest_high - 2.0 * ATR OR short and price > lowest_low + 2.0 * ATR
# Uses discrete sizing 0.25 to manage drawdown (BTC -77% in 2022 → ~19.3% loss at 0.25 exposure)
# Target: 75-200 total trades over 4 years (19-50/year) for 4h timeframe
# Camarilla R1/S1 provide tighter breakout levels than R3/S3 for more frequent but still filtered signals
# 1d EMA34 filters medium-term trend, volume spike ensures conviction, ATR(14) stoploss manages risk
