# Hypothesis: 6h strategy using 1d Williams Fractal breakout with 1w EMA50 trend filter and volume confirmation.
# Enter long when price breaks above the most recent bullish fractal (HIGH) with volume > 2.0x 30-bar average and price > 1w EMA50 (uptrend).
# Enter short when price breaks below the most recent bearish fractal (LOW) with volume > 2.0x 30-bar average and price < 1w EMA50 (downtrend).
# Exit on opposite fractal level (bearish for long exit, bullish for short exit).
# Uses discrete position sizing (0.25) to control risk. Target: 75-150 total trades over 4 years.
# Williams Fractals provide swing high/low structure, volume confirms breakout strength,
# 1w EMA50 filters counter-trend noise. Works in bull (breakouts with trend) and bear (failed breaks via exits) markets.
