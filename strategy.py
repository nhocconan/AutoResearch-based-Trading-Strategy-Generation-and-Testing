# Hypothesis: 4h Camarilla R1/S1 breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume spike
# Uses Camarilla pivot levels from previous day (R1, S1) for precise entry
# Long when price breaks above R1 with bullish 1d trend and volume spike
# Short when price breaks below S1 with bearish 1d trend and volume spike
# Designed for 4h timeframe to target 20-40 trades/year per symbol.
# Works in bull/bear via multi-timeframe trend alignment and volatility-based signals.
