4h_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_1dTrend_VolumeFilter
Hypothesis: Camarilla pivot R1/S1 breakouts with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume spikes capture institutional breakout moves in both bull and bear markets. Camarilla levels identify key support/resistance where institutional order flow concentrates. The 1d EMA34 filter ensures trading with the daily trend, while volume confirmation avoids false breakouts. Targets 19-50 trades/year on 4h timeframe.
