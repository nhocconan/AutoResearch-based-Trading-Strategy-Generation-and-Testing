# Hypothesis: 4-hour Donchian channel breakout with 1-day EMA trend filter and volume confirmation.
# Uses Donchian(20) breakouts for trend continuation, filtered by 1-day EMA(50) for trend direction.
# Volume confirmation ensures institutional participation. Designed for 4h timeframe to target 75-200 trades over 4 years.
# Works in both bull and bear markets by only taking breakouts in the direction of the higher timeframe trend.
