12h_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_Volume_Confirm
Hypothesis: On 12h, enter long when price breaks above Camarilla R1 (H4) with volume confirmation, short when breaks below S1 (L4). Uses 1d trend filter (EMA34) to avoid counter-trend trades. Designed for 15-25 trades/year to minimize fee drag and work in both bull/bear regimes via trend alignment. Camarilla levels provide institutional support/resistance, volume confirms institutional participation.
