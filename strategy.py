# 12h_Pivot_R1_S1_Breakout_Volume_Trend
# Hypothesis: 12h price breaks Camarilla R1/S1 with volume spike and trend confirmation (1d EMA34).
# Works in bull/bear by following trend direction. Uses 12h timeframe for lower frequency
# and higher win rate. Target: 12-37 trades/year (50-150 total over 4 years).
# Uses 1d EMA34 for trend filter and volume spike for momentum confirmation.
