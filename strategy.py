# 4h_1d_camarilla_breakout_v2
# Hypothesis: 4-hour breakout of Camarilla levels from daily timeframe with volume confirmation.
# Uses tight entry conditions (breakout of R4/S4 levels) and exits on retest of S3/R3.
# Designed to work in both bull and bear markets by focusing on volatility-adjusted breakouts.
# Target: 20-50 trades/year (80-200 total over 4 years) to minimize fee drag.
