# Hypothesis: 12h timeframe with 1d Donchian channel breakout and volume confirmation.
# Long: Price closes above Donchian upper band (20-period high) + volume > 1.3x 20-period average volume.
# Short: Price closes below Donchian lower band (20-period low) + volume > 1.3x 20-period average volume.
# Exit: Opposite band touch (long exits at lower band, short exits at upper band).
# Uses 1d Donchian channels for structure, 12h for execution with volume filter to reduce false breakouts.
# Position size: 0.25 (25%) to manage drawdown in volatile markets.
# Target: 50-150 total trades over 4 years (12-37/year) for 12h timeframe.
