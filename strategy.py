"""
12h Donchian Breakout with 1d EMA34 Trend Filter and Volume Spike
Hypothesis: Donchian(20) breakouts capture medium-term momentum on 12h timeframe.
Trend filter uses 1d EMA34 for higher reliability, volume spike confirms breakout strength.
Works in bull markets (long upper band breakouts) and bear markets (short lower band breakouts).
Designed for low trade frequency (12-37/year) to minimize fee drag and improve test generalization.
