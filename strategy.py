"""
6h Donchian(20) breakout with 1d pivot direction and volume confirmation
Hypothesis: Donchian breakouts capture institutional momentum. Filter by 1d pivot for bias (above/below pivot) and volume for conviction. Works in bull (buy breakouts above pivot) and bear (sell breakdowns below pivot). Target: 75-200 total trades over 4 years.
