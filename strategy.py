# 6h_WeeklyPivotBreakout_1dTrendVolume - Novel weekly pivot breakout strategy for 6h timeframe
# Hypothesis: Breakouts from weekly pivot levels (R4/S4) with 1d trend filter and volume spike
# captures institutional-level support/resistance breaks. Weekly pivots are more significant
# than daily pivots and less prone to noise. Works in both bull/bear markets by filtering
# with 1d trend and requiring volume confirmation to avoid false breakouts.
# Target: 60-120 total trades over 4 years (15-30/year) with size 0.25
