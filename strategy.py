# Hypothesis: 4h Camarilla R1/S1 breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume confirmation
# - Camarilla R1/S1 are key intraday support/resistance levels derived from previous day's range
# - Breakouts above R1 or below S1 with volume confirmation capture institutional moves
# - 1d EMA34 ensures alignment with daily trend (works in both bull and bear markets)
# - Volume spike (2.0x average) filters for significant moves
# - Position size 0.25 targets ~20-30 trades/year, avoiding excessive fee drag
# - Exit when price returns to opposite S1/R1 level or volume diminishes
# - Works in bull markets (buy R1 breakouts in uptrend) and bear markets (sell S1 breakdowns in downtrend)
