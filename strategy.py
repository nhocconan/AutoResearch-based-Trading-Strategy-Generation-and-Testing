# Hypothesis: Camarilla R1/S1 levels act as strong support/resistance on daily timeframe.
# Long when price breaks above R1 in daily uptrend with volume confirmation.
# Short when price breaks below S1 in daily downtrend with volume confirmation.
# Daily EMA34 filter ensures we trade with the higher timeframe trend.
# Volume spike confirms institutional participation. Cooldown prevents overtrading.
# Effective in both bull (captures breakouts) and bear (avoids counter-trend trades).
