12h_Price_Channel_Breakout_Volume_Trend
Hypothesis: Breakouts above 20-period high or below 20-period low with volume confirmation 
and 1-day EMA trend filter work in both bull and bear markets. Uses 12h timeframe to 
minimize fee capture while capturing significant moves.
Target: 20-40 trades/year on 12h timeframe with strict entry conditions.
