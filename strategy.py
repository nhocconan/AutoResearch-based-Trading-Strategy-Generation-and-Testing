1d_1w_camarilla_breakout_volume
Hypothesis: Daily chart with weekly trend filter. Weekly trend determined by whether price is above/below weekly 200-period EMA.
Enter long when daily close breaks above previous day's R4 level with volume confirmation during weekly uptrend.
Enter short when daily close breaks below previous day's S4 level with volume confirmation during weekly downtrend.
Exit on opposite S3/R3 touch.
Designed for low trade frequency (<25/year) to minimize fee drag, works in bull/bear via trend filter.
