# Hypothesis: 12h Williams Fractal breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume confirmation
# Uses 1d EMA34 for higher timeframe trend alignment to reduce whipsaw
# Williams Fractals from prior 1d session provide swing high/low breakout levels
# Volume confirmation (>1.5x 20 EMA) filters low-participation false breakouts
# Session filter (08-20 UTC) to avoid low-liquidity periods
# Discrete sizing 0.25 limits risk and reduces fee churn
# Target: 50-150 total trades over 4 years = 12-37/year for 12h.
# Works in both bull and bear: trend filter adapts to higher timeframe direction.
