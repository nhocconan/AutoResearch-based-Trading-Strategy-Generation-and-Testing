# Hypothesis: 12h Camarilla R3/S3 breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume spike confirmation
# Camarilla R3/S3 levels represent stronger intraday support/resistance than R1/S1.
# Breakout above R3 or below S3 with volume spike indicates strong institutional participation.
# 1d EMA34 ensures alignment with daily trend, reducing whipsaw in ranging markets.
# Designed to work in both bull and bear markets by taking breakouts in direction of daily trend.
# Target: 12-37 trades/year (50-150 total over 4 years) to minimize fee drag while maintaining edge.
