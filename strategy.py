1D_Weekly_Pivot_Breakout_Trend_Filter
Hypothesis: Weekly pivot points (R1/S1) on 1w timeframe act as significant support/resistance levels.
Breakouts above weekly R1 or below weekly S1 with daily trend alignment and volume confirmation
capture momentum moves while avoiding false breakouts. This weekly structure works in both bull
and bear markets by focusing on major turning points. Position size 0.25 targets ~15-25 trades/year
to minimize fee drag on daily timeframe.
