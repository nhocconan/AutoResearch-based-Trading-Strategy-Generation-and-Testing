# Hypothesis: 6h Williams Fractal breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume spike confirmation.
# Uses Williams Fractals (bearish for short, bullish for long) from prior 1d as structure levels.
# 1d EMA34 for higher timeframe trend filter (more responsive than 200, smoother than 20).
# Volume confirmation (>1.8x 24-bar avg) to reduce false breakouts.
# Discrete position sizing at ±0.25 to balance capture and fee drag.
# Target: 60-120 total trades over 4 years (15-30/year) to avoid overtrading on 6h.
# Session filter (08:00-20:00 UTC) to avoid low-liquidity periods.
