4h_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_1dTrend_Volume
Hypothesis: Price breaks above Camarilla R1 (long) or below S1 (short) derived from daily levels,
with daily EMA34 trend filter and volume confirmation. Camarilla levels provide mean-reversion
boundaries that often act as support/resistance; breakouts from these levels with trend alignment
capture momentum moves. Volume confirmation filters false breakouts. Works in bull/bear by trading
only in direction of daily trend. Target: 20-30 trades/year (80-120 total) to minimize fee drag.
