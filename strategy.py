# Hypothesis: 12h Williams Fractal breakout with 1w EMA50 trend filter and volume confirmation
# Williams fractals identify key swing points where price reverses; breakouts above/below
# recent fractal levels indicate strong momentum. 1w EMA50 ensures alignment with long-term trend
# to avoid counter-trend trades. Volume confirmation filters low-participation moves.
# Designed for 12h timeframe targeting 50-150 total trades over 4 years (12-37/year)
# Discrete sizing 0.25 to balance profit potential and fee drag
