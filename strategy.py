1d_1w_camarilla_breakout_volume_v1
Hypothesis: Use weekly bias from SMA(50) and daily Camarilla levels for breakout entries with volume confirmation.
Long when price breaks above daily R3 with volume and weekly bias up.
Short when price breaks below daily S3 with volume and weekly bias down.
Designed to capture strong momentum moves while avoiding choppy markets.
Target: 10-25 trades/year per symbol (40-100 total over 4 years).
