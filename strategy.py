# Hypothesis: 4h Donchian(20) breakout with volume confirmation and ATR trailing stop
# - Uses 1d HTF to calculate prior day's high/low for breakout levels (more robust than Camarilla)
# - Long when price closes above 20-period Donchian high with volume > 1.5x 20-period average
# - Short when price closes below 20-period Donchian low with volume > 1.5x 20-period average
# - ATR(14) trailing stop: exit long at 2.0x ATR below highest high since entry
# - Fixed position size 0.25 to control drawdown
# - Donchian channels provide clear structure, volume filters false breakouts
# - Target: 20-40 trades/year on 4h timeframe (80-160 total over 4 years)
