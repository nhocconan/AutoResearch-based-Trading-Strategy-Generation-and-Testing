12h_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_1dTrend_VolumeSpike_v1
Hypothesis: 12h Camarilla R1/S1 breakout with daily EMA34 trend filter and volume spike confirmation.
- Long when price breaks above Camarilla R1 AND daily EMA34 uptrend AND volume > 1.8 * volume_ma(20)
- Short when price breaks below Camarilla S3 AND daily EMA34 downtrend AND volume > 1.8 * volume_ma(20)
- Uses Camarilla levels from daily chart for structure-based breakouts (R1/S1 = inner support/resistance)
- Daily EMA34 filter ensures trading with higher timeframe trend to avoid counter-trend whipsaws in bear markets
- Volume spike confirms institutional participation and reduces false breakouts
- Designed for low frequency (target 12-37 trades/year on 12h) to minimize fee drag
- Exit on opposite Camarilla level touch (R1/S1) or trend reversal
