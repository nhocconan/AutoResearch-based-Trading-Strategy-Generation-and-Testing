Experiment #2855: 6h Camarilla Pivot Fade + Volume Spike + 1w Trend Filter
HYPOTHESIS: Camarilla pivot levels (R3/S3, R4/S4) from daily timeframe act as 
intraday support/resistance. Fade trades at R3/S3 with volume confirmation and 
weekly trend filter capture mean reversals in ranging markets while avoiding 
strong trends. Weekly trend filter ensures we only fade against the weekly trend 
(buy in weekly uptrend at S3, sell in weekly downtrend at R3), reducing false 
signals. 6h timeframe balances trade frequency and fee drag. Target: 75-150 total 
trades over 4 years.
