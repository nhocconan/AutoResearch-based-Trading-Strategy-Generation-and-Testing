4h Camarilla R1/S1 Breakout + 1d EMA34 Trend + Volume Spike
Hypothesis: Camarilla pivot levels (R1/S1) act as intraday support/resistance. A breakout beyond these levels, when aligned with the 1d EMA34 trend and confirmed by a volume spike, captures strong momentum moves while filtering false breakouts. Works in both bull and bear markets by following the primary trend. Uses discrete position sizing (0.30) to limit fee churn and targets 20-50 trades/year.
