# Hypothesis: 4h Williams Fractal breakout with volume confirmation and 1d EMA trend filter
# Uses daily Williams Fractals for high-probability reversal points
# Trend filter prevents counter-trade trades; volume confirms breakout strength
# Target: 20-35 trades/year per symbol, works in bull/bear via trend alignment
