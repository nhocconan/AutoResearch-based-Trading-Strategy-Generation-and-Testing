12h_Camarilla_R1S1_Breakout_1dTrend_VolumeConfirm_v2
Hypothesis: Camarilla R1/S1 breakouts on 12h with 1d EMA50 trend filter and volume confirmation.
R1/S1 are inner Camarilla levels that act as magnet points for mean reversion but breakouts
beyond them indicate strong momentum. Uses 1d EMA50 for trend direction (more responsive than 34
but smoother than shorter EMAs) to filter breakouts in direction of higher timeframe trend.
Volume spike (>2x 24-bar average) confirms participation. Exits on reversion to Camarilla C (midpoint).
Discrete position sizing (0.25) minimizes fee churn. Target: 12-30 trades/year on 12h.
Designed to work in bull markets (breakouts with trend) and bear markets (breakdowns against trend)
by using 1d trend filter to avoid counter-trend whipsaws.
