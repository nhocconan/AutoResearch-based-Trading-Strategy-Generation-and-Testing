4h_Camarilla_R1S1_Breakout_1dEMA34_VolumeSpike
Hypothesis: Camarilla R1/S1 breakouts on 4h with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume spike confirmation.
R1/S1 are the innermost Camarilla levels, providing high-probability mean reversion breakouts.
Uses 1d EMA34 for trend direction to filter breakouts in the direction of the daily trend.
Volume spike (>2x 20-bar average) confirms institutional participation. Exits on reversion to Camarilla C (midpoint).
Discrete position sizing (0.25) minimizes fee churn. Target: 30-60 trades/year.
Works in bull markets (breakouts with trend) and bear markets (breakouts against trend for shorts).
