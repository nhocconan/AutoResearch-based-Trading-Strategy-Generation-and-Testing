# Hypothesis: 1d Camarilla pivot S1/R1 breakout with 1w EMA34 trend filter and volume spike
# Camarilla levels provide high-probability intraday reversal/breakout points
# Trade only in direction of 1w EMA34 trend (bullish if price > EMA34, bearish if price < EMA34)
# Volume confirmation ensures breakout has conviction
# Designed for lower trade frequency on 1d timeframe (~10-25 trades/year) to minimize fee drag
# Works in both bull and bear markets by following weekly trend while capturing daily momentum
