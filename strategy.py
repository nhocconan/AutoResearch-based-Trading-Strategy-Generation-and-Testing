# Hypothesis: 1d Donchian(20) breakout with 1w EMA50 trend filter and volume confirmation
# Long when price breaks above 20-day high AND price > 1w EMA50 (uptrend) AND volume > 2.0 * 20-day avg volume
# Short when price breaks below 20-day low AND price < 1w EMA50 (downtrend) AND volume > 2.0 * 20-day avg volume
# Exit with ATR-based trailing stop: signal→0 when long and price < highest_high - 2.5 * ATR OR short and price > lowest_low + 2.5 * ATR
# Uses discrete sizing 0.25 to manage drawdown (BTC -77% in 2022 → ~19.25% loss at 0.25 exposure)
# Target: 30-100 total trades over 4 years (7-25/year) for 1d timeframe
# Donchian channels provide robust trend-following structure based on price extremes
# Volume confirmation ensures conviction behind breakouts, reducing false signals
# ATR trailing stop manages risk while allowing trends to develop
# Works in bull via buying breakouts in uptrend, works in bear via selling breakdowns in downtrend
