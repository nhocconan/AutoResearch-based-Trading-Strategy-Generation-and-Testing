# Hypothesis: 1d Donchian channel breakout with 1-week EMA trend filter and volume confirmation.
# Long when price breaks above 20-day high, above 1-week EMA50, and volume > 2x average.
# Short when price breaks below 20-day low, below 1-week EMA50, and volume > 2x average.
# Exit when price re-enters between 20-day low and high (mean reversion).
# Uses 1-week EMA for trend filter to capture primary trend and reduce whipsaw.
# Target: 10-25 trades/year to minimize fee decay while capturing major trends.
# Works in bull markets (trend following) and bear markets (short signals during downtrends).
