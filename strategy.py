# Hypothesis: 4h Camarilla pivot breakout with 1d volume confirmation and ATR trailing stop
# - Uses 1d HTF for Camarilla pivot levels (H4, L4, H3, L3) from prior day
# - Long when price breaks above H4 with volume > 1.5x 20-period average
# - Short when price breaks below L4 with volume > 1.5x 20-period average
# - ATR(14) trailing stop: exit at 2.0x ATR from extreme since entry
# - Fixed position size 0.25 to control drawdown
# - Target: 20-50 trades/year on 4h timeframe (80-200 total over 4 years)
# - Works in bull/bear by capturing breakouts in trending phases; volume filter reduces false signals
