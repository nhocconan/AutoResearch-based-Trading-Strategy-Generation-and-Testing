# Hypothesis: 12h Williams %R mean reversion with 1d volume confirmation and ATR stoploss
# - Uses Williams %R(14) on 12h for overbought/oversold signals: long when %R < -80, short when %R > -20
# - Requires volume > 1.5 * 20-period volume average for confirmation (reduces false signals)
# - Uses ATR(14) for dynamic stoploss (2.5 * ATR) and discrete position sizing (0.25)
# - Works in bull markets via mean reversion from oversold, in bear via mean reversion from overbought
# - Target: 12-30 trades/year on 12h timeframe (48-120 total over 4 years) to minimize fee drag
# - Williams %R provides reliable mean reversion signals in ranging markets common to BTC/ETH
