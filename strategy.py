12h_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_1dTrend_VolumeConfirm_v1
Hypothesis: Trade 12h Camarilla R1/S1 breakouts with 1d EMA trend filter and volume confirmation.
- Trend filter: price > 1d EMA(34) = bullish, price < 1d EMA(34) = bearish.
- In bullish 1d trend: buy breakouts above R1, sell breakdowns below S1.
- In bearish 1d trend: sell breakdowns below S1, buy breakouts above R1 (counter-trend fade).
- Volume confirmation: require volume > 1.3x 20-period average to avoid false breakouts.
- Position size: 0.25. Target: 50-150 total trades over 4 years = 12-37/year.
- Works in both bull and bear: EMA trend filter adapts to market regime, volume filters noise.
