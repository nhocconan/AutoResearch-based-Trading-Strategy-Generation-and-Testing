# Hypothesis: 6h Elder Ray Index with 1d regime filter and volume confirmation
# - Bull Power = High - EMA(13), Bear Power = EMA(13) - Low
# - Long when Bull Power > 0 AND Bear Power < 0 (strong bullish momentum) AND 1d close > 1d SMA(50) (bullish regime) AND volume > 1.5x 20-period volume SMA
# - Short when Bear Power > 0 AND Bull Power < 0 (strong bearish momentum) AND 1d close < 1d SMA(50) (bearish regime) AND volume > 1.5x 20-period volume SMA
# - Exit: Elder Ray divergence (Bull Power < 0 for longs, Bear Power < 0 for shorts) OR ATR trailing stop (2.5x ATR)
# - Uses 1d for regime filter (trend bias) and 6h for precise Elder Ray calculation
# - Session filter: 08-20 UTC to avoid low-volume Asian session noise
# - Position sizing: 0.25 discrete level to control drawdown and minimize fee churn
# - Target: 12-37 trades/year (50-150 total over 4 years) to minimize fee drag while maintaining statistical significance
# - Elder Ray measures bull/bear power behind price movements, effective in both trending and ranging markets
# - Uses previous completed 1d bar for regime calculation to avoid look-ahead
