12h_Camarilla_R3_S3_Breakout_1dTrend_Volume
Hypothesis: Price breakouts from Camarilla R3/S3 levels on 12h timeframe, filtered by 1-day trend direction and volume confirmation. Camarilla levels act as strong support/resistance in ranging markets, while breakouts signal momentum shifts. The 1-day EMA filter ensures alignment with the higher timeframe trend, reducing false signals during counter-trend moves. Volume confirmation filters out low-momentum breakouts. Designed for 12h timeframe to capture significant moves with low trade frequency (~15-30/year), minimizing fee drag while capturing trends in both bull and bear markets.
