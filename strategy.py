# Hypothesis: 4h Williams Fractal Breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume spike confirmation
# Uses Williams Fractals from 1d for structural breakouts, 1d EMA34 for trend filter, and volume spike for confirmation
# Entry: Long when bullish fractal breaks above previous high with volume spike and price > 1d EMA34 (uptrend)
#        Short when bearish fractal breaks below previous low with volume spike and price < 1d EMA34 (downtrend)
# Exit: Opposite fractal break or trend reversal (price crosses 1d EMA34)
# Target: 75-200 total trades over 4 years (19-50/year) for 4h timeframe
# Discrete sizing 0.25 balances profit potential and fee drag
