6h_Camarilla_R3S3_Breakout_1dTrend_Volume
Hypothesis: Camarilla pivot levels from 1-day chart provide strong support/resistance. 
Breaking above R3 or below S3 with 1-day EMA34 trend confirmation and volume spike (1.5x average) 
captures institutional breakouts. Designed for 6h to balance trade frequency (target 50-150 total trades over 4 years) 
and performance, avoiding excessive trades that cause fee drag while maintaining edge in both bull and bear markets 
by following higher timeframe trend.
