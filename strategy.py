# Hypothesis: 12h Donchian(20) breakout with 1d trend filter and volume confirmation.
# Long when price breaks above Donchian(20) high and 1d close > 1d open (bullish day).
# Short when price breaks below Donchian(20) low and 1d close < 1d open (bearish day).
# Volume > 1.5x 20-period average for confirmation.
# Daily trend filter avoids counter-trend trades. Donchian breakouts capture momentum.
# Target: 75-150 total trades over 4 years (19-38/year).
