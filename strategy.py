12h_1d_Camarilla_R3_S3_Breakout_TrendVol_v1
Hypothesis: 12-hour breakouts from Camarilla R3/S3 levels (based on 1-day price action) with 1-day trend filter and volume spike confirmation.
Targets 12h timeframe to balance trade frequency while using proven 1d Camarilla levels and 1d trend filter.
Only takes long when price breaks above R3 with volume spike and 1d uptrend, short when breaks below S3 with volume spike and 1d downtrend.
Designed to work in both bull and bear markets via trend filter and volume confirmation to avoid false breakouts.
Focuses on stronger breakout levels (R3/S3) for higher quality signals.
