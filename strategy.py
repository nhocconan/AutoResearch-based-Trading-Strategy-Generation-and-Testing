# Hypothesis: 6h Williams Fractal breakout with 1w trend filter and volume confirmation
# Long when price breaks above latest bearish fractal AND price > 1w EMA50 AND volume > 2x 20-bar avg
# Short when price breaks below latest bullish fractal AND price < 1w EMA50 AND volume > 2x 20-bar avg
# Exit when price crosses opposite fractal level (bullish fractal for longs, bearish for shorts)
# Uses discrete position sizing (0.25) to minimize fee churn while capturing moves.
# Target: 50-150 total trades over 4 years (12-37/year) on 6h.
# Williams Fractals identify key swing points where price often reverses or accelerates.
# 1w EMA50 filters counter-trend moves, volume spike ensures institutional participation.
# Works in bull markets (trend continuation via breakouts) and bear markets (mean reversion within trend via exits).
