# Hypothesis: 1d Camarilla pivot breakout with 1w EMA trend filter and volume confirmation
# - Uses 1d Camarilla pivot levels (H3/L3) for breakout entries in direction of 1w EMA trend
# - Requires volume > 1.8x 20-period average to confirm breakout strength
# - ATR(14) trailing stop at 2.5x ATR from extreme for risk control
# - Position size: 0.25 (25% of capital) - discrete level to minimize fee churn
# - Target: ~15 trades/year (60 total over 4 years) to stay well under fee drag threshold
# - Camarilla pivots work well in ranging markets (2025+ bearish bias) while EMA filter avoids counter-trend trades
# - Volume confirmation ensures breakout legitimacy, reducing false signals
