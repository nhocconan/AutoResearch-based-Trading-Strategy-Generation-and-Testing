# Hypothesis: 12h Williams Fractal breakout with 1d EMA(34) trend filter and volume spike confirmation
# Williams Fractals identify potential reversal points; breakout above bearish fractal or below bullish fractal with volume confirmation captures momentum
# 1d EMA(34) filters for primary trend alignment (long when price > EMA, short when price < EMA)
# Volume spike (2.0x 20-period average) ensures strong participation and reduces false breakouts
# Uses discrete position sizing 0.25 to minimize fee churn
# Targets 12-30 trades/year (50-120 total over 4 years) to stay within fee drag limits
# Works in both bull and bear markets by requiring volume confirmation and primary trend alignment
