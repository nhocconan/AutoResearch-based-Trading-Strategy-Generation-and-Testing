"""
4h Williams Fractal Breakout + Volume Spike + ATR Stop
Hypothesis: Williams fractals on 1d identify major swing points with 2-bar confirmation delay. Breakouts above/below these levels with volume confirmation capture strong momentum moves. ATR-based trailing stop limits downside. Works in bull (buy breakouts above bearish fractals) and bear (sell breakdowns below bullish fractals) via symmetric logic. Target 20-50 trades/year on 4h to avoid fee drag.
