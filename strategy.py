4h_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_1dTrend_VolumeS
Hypothesis: Use Camarilla pivot levels from 1d as key support/resistance. 
In trending markets (determined by 1d EMA34), price tends to respect Camarilla levels.
Long when price breaks above R1 in uptrend with volume confirmation.
Short when price breaks below S1 in downtrend with volume confirmation.
Camarilla levels provide precise intraday levels that work well on 4h timeframe.
Targets 80-160 trades over 4 years (20-40/year) to balance opportunity and fee cost.
Works in both bull (buy breakouts above resistance) and bear (sell breakdowns below support).
