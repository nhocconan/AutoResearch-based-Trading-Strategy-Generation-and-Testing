# 12h_Camarilla_Pivot_R1_S1_Breakout_Volume_Confirmation
# Hypothesis: 12h Camarilla pivot levels (R1, S1) derived from 1d OHLC provide institutional support/resistance.
# Breakout above R1 or below S1 with volume confirmation signals institutional interest.
# In bull markets: R1 breakouts lead to continuation. In bear markets: S1 breaks lead to continuation.
# Volume confirmation filters false breakouts. Works in both regimes via directional breakouts.
# Target: 50-150 total trades over 4 years (12-37/year) to avoid fee drag.
