# Hypothesis: 6h Bollinger Bands breakout with daily trend filter and volume confirmation.
# Long when price breaks above upper BB during bullish day with volume > 1.5x 20-period average.
# Short when price breaks below lower BB during bearish day with volume confirmation.
# Uses daily trend filter to avoid counter-trend trades. BB provides dynamic volatility-based breakout levels.
# Target: 75-150 total trades over 4 years (19-38/year) to stay within optimal range.
