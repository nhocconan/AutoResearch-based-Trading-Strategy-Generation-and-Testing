4h_Camarilla_R3_S3_Breakout_1dTrend_VolumeSpike
Hypothesis: 4h Camarilla R3/S3 breakout with 1d trend filter and volume confirmation.
Long when price breaks above R3 in 1d uptrend with volume spike.
Short when price breaks below S3 in 1d downtrend with volume spike.
Camarilla levels provide precise intraday support/resistance; 1d trend filters for higher timeframe bias.
Discrete position sizing (0.25) to minimize fee churn. Targets 20-50 trades/year on 4h.
Works in bull/bear by following 1d trend. Camarilla levels adapt to volatility.
