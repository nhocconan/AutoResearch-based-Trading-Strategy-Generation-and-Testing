4h Donchian(20) Breakout with 1d Trend Filter and Volume Confirmation
Hypothesis: Breakouts from Donchian channels on 4h, filtered by 1d trend direction (price above/below SMA200),
and confirmed by volume spikes, capture momentum across market regimes. The 1d SMA200 filter helps avoid
whipsaws in sideways markets while capturing trends in both bull and bear phases. Volume ensures breakout

4h Donchian(20) Breakout with 1d Trend Filter and Volume Confirmation
Hypothesis: Breakouts from Donchian channels on 4h, filtered by 1d trend direction (price above/below SMA200),
and confirmed by volume spikes, capture momentum across market regimes. The 1d SMA200 filter helps avoid
whipsaws in sideways markets while capturing trends in both bull and bear phases. Volume ensures breakout
legitimacy. Target: 75-200 total trades over 4 years.
