# 1d_Weekly_Range_Breakout_With_Volume
# Hypothesis: Uses weekly price range (high-low) from prior week to set breakout levels.
# Long when price breaks above prior week's high with volume confirmation.
# Short when price breaks below prior week's low with volume confirmation.
# Weekly timeframe provides stable structure; daily execution captures timely entries.
# Designed to work in both trending and ranging markets by capturing breakouts from consolidation.
# Target: 15-25 trades/year per symbol with disciplined risk (0.25 position size).
