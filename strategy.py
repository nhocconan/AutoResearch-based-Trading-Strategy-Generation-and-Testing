# Hypothesis: 12h Camarilla R3/S3 breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume confirmation
# Camarilla pivot levels provide high-probability intraday reversal/breakout points
# 1d EMA34 ensures we only trade in the direction of the higher timeframe trend
# Volume confirmation requires 2.0x average volume to ensure strong participation (tightened from 1.8x to reduce trades)
# Target: 12-25 trades/year (50-100 total over 4 years) to minimize fee drag on 12h timeframe
# Works in both bull and bear markets by following the 1d trend direction and using mean-reversion breakouts
