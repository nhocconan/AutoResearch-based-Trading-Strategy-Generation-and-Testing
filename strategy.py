# Hypothesis: Camarilla R3/S3 breakout with daily trend filter and volume confirmation on 12h timeframe.
# Long when price breaks above R3 level with volume spike in daily uptrend.
# Short when price breaks below S3 level with volume spike in daily downtrend.
# Exits on reversal to S3/R3 levels or trend change.
# Uses daily Camarilla levels for intraday support/resistance and EMA34 for trend.
# Volume confirmation filters false breakouts. Cooldown prevents overtrading.
# Target: 20-40 trades/year to avoid fee drift. Works in bull/bear by capturing
# significant intraday moves with trend alignment. Daily timeframe reduces noise.
