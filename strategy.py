# Hypothesis: 12-hour Donchian breakout with 1-day volume confirmation and 1-week ATR filter.
# Uses Donchian channel breakouts for trend following, filtered by volume surge
# and volatility regime (ATR-based) to avoid false breakouts in low volatility.
# Designed for low frequency (target 50-150 trades over 4 years) with clear
# entry/exit rules to minimize whipsaw and fee drag. Works in both bull and
# bear markets by following breakouts in direction of higher timeframe trend.
