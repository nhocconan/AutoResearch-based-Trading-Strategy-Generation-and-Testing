# Hypothesis: 6h strategy combining weekly pivot points for trend direction
# and daily Donchian breakouts for entry timing, with volume confirmation.
# Weekly pivots define the trend (above/below weekly pivot point), daily
# Donchian breakouts provide entry signals in the direction of the weekly trend.
# Volume filter ensures momentum confirmation. Designed for 12-37 trades/year
# (50-150 total over 4 years) to avoid overtrading. Works in bull/bear by
# following higher timeframe weekly trends.
