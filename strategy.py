# Hypothesis: 12h Camarilla Pivot (S1/R1) breakout with 1d EMA trend filter and volume confirmation.
# Uses daily Camarilla pivot levels calculated from previous day's high/low/close.
# Long when price breaks above R1 with EMA(34) uptrend and volume spike.
# Short when price breaks below S1 with EMA(34) downtrend and volume spike.
# Designed for 12h timeframe to target 12-37 trades/year per symbol (50-150 total over 4 years).
# Works in bull/bear via daily trend filter and volatility-based breakout logic.
