4h_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_1dEMA34_Trend_VolumeSpike
Hypothesis: 4h Camarilla R1/S1 breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume confirmation (>2.0x 20-period MA).
Long when price breaks above R1 in 1d uptrend with volume spike. Short when price breaks below S1 in 1d downtrend with volume spike.
Uses discrete position sizing (0.25) to minimize fee churn. Camarilla levels calculated from prior 1d candle to avoid look-ahead.
Designed to work in both bull and bear markets by following the 1d trend. Target: 19-50 trades/year (75-200 total over 4 years).
