# 4H_Camarilla_R1S1_Breakout_12hTrend_Volume
# Hypothesis: Buy when price breaks above Camarilla R1 level with 12h EMA50 uptrend and volume confirmation, sell when price breaks below S1 with 12h EMA50 downtrend and volume confirmation. Uses 12h timeframe for trend filter and daily for Camarilla levels. Designed for low frequency (20-50 trades/year) to minimize fee drag. Works in bull and bear markets via trend filter.
