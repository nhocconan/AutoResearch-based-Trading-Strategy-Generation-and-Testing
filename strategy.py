# 12h_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_1dTrend_Volume
# Hypothesis: Uses Camarilla pivot levels (R1, S1) from daily timeframe for breakout entries on 12h timeframe, filtered by daily trend structure (HH/HL/LH/LL) and volume spikes. Long when price breaks above R1 in a daily uptrend with volume confirmation; short when price breaks below S1 in a daily downtrend with volume confirmation. Exit when price returns to the Camarilla pivot level (PP) or daily trend breaks. Designed to capture intraday momentum within the daily trend while avoiding false breakouts in low-volume conditions. Works in bull markets by buying dips in uptrends and in bear markets by selling rallies in downtrends.
