# Hypothesis: 1d Weekly Pivot S1/R1 breakout with weekly trend and volume confirmation
# - Weekly Pivot S1/R1 act as key support/resistance levels from prior week
# - Breakout above S1 with volume in weekly uptrend = long opportunity
# - Breakdown below R1 with volume in weekly downtrend = short opportunity
# - Volume spike (2.0x average) confirms institutional participation
# - Weekly EMA(34) with 2-bar delay ensures trend confirmation only after weekly close
# - Works in both bull (buy S1 breaks in uptrend) and bear (sell R1 breaks in downtrend)
# - Exit when price returns to S1/R1 or volume weakens slightly
# - Position size 0.25 targets ~15-35 trades/year, avoiding fee drag
# - Uses actual weekly Pivot levels (not daily) for better stability
# - Weekly trend filter reduces whipsaws vs using same timeframe
# - Designed to work in BOTH bull and bear markets via trend filter
# - Volume confirmation reduces false breakouts
# - Novel combination: Weekly Pivot (1w) + weekly trend (1w) + volume (1d) on 1d timeframe
