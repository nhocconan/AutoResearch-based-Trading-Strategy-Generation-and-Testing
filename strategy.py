# Hypothesis: 4h Camarilla R4/S4 breakout with 1d EMA50 trend and volume spike
# Uses wider Camarilla bands (R4/S4) for fewer but higher-probability breakouts.
# Requires alignment with 1d EMA50 trend and volume spike to filter false signals.
# Designed for low-frequency trades (<100 total) to minimize fee drag in bear markets.
