# Hypothesis: 4h Williams Fractal breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume spike confirmation.
# Long when price breaks above bearish fractal AND 1d EMA34 uptrend AND volume > 2.0x 20-period median.
# Short when price breaks below bullish fractal AND 1d EMA34 downtrend AND volume > 2.0x 20-period median.
# Williams Fractals provide swing high/low levels; 1d EMA34 ensures higher-timeframe alignment; volume confirms breakout strength.
# Works in bull markets (buy breakouts in uptrend) and bear markets (sell breakdowns in downtrend).
# Target: 19-50 trades/year on 4h timeframe (75-200 total over 4 years) to minimize fee drag.
