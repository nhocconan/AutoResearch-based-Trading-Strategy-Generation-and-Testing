# 6h_Camarilla_R3_S3_Breakout_1dTrend_Volume
# Hypothesis: Camarilla pivot breakout at R3/S3 levels with 1-day EMA34 trend filter and volume spike confirmation on 6h timeframe.
# The Camarilla pivot system identifies key support/resistance levels based on previous day's price action.
# Breaking above R3 or below S3 with volume confirmation indicates strong momentum in the direction of the breakout.
# The 1-day EMA34 filter ensures trades align with the daily trend, reducing false signals.
# This strategy targets 12-37 trades per year (50-150 over 4 years) with low trade frequency to minimize fee drag.
# Works in bull markets by buying R3 breakouts in uptrends and in bear markets by selling S3 breakdowns in downtrends.
