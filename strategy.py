# 4h_1d_Camarilla_R1S1_Volume_Trend_Reversal
# Hypothesis: Uses 1d Camarilla R1/S1 levels on 4h chart with volume confirmation and trend filter.
# Trades only when price breaks R1/S1 with volume and in direction of 1d EMA trend.
# Inverse logic: short at R1 resistance, long at S1 support for mean-reversion in ranging markets.
# Designed for fewer trades (<200/year) to avoid fee drag, works in both bull/bear via trend filter.
