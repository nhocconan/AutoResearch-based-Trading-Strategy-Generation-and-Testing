1d_Camarilla_R1S1_Breakout_VolumeFilter_V1
Hypothesis: Daily breakouts above R1 or below S1 with volume confirmation (2x average) capture strong directional moves in both bull and bear markets. Volume ensures breakout conviction, reducing false signals. Targets 20-50 trades/year by requiring both price breakout and volume surge. Works in all regimes by only taking breakouts with institutional participation.
