# Hypothesis: 1d Camarilla pivot breakout with volume confirmation and weekly trend filter
# Long when price breaks above R1 + volume > 1.3x avg + weekly close > weekly open (bullish week)
# Short when price breaks below S1 + volume > 1.3x avg + weekly close < weekly open (bearish week)
# Uses discrete position sizing (0.25) to minimize fee drag. Target: 15-25 trades/year.
# Works in bull/bear: weekly trend filter ensures we only trade with higher-timeframe momentum
