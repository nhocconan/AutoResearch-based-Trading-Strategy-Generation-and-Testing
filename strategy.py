# Hypothesis: Daily RSI mean reversion with 12h execution captures overextended moves
# in both bull and bear markets. In bull markets, RSI < 30 during uptrends signals
# pullback buying opportunities. In bear markets, RSI > 70 during downtrends signals
# rally selling opportunities. The 12h timeframe reduces noise while maintaining
# responsiveness. Volume confirmation ensures genuine participation, and trend
# alignment prevents counter-trend trades. Conservative sizing (0.25) manages
# drawdown during extended trends. Target: 15-30 trades/year to minimize fee drag.
