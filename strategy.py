1d_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_1wTrend_VolumeSpike_v1
Hypothesis: On 1d timeframe, Camarilla R1/S1 breakouts with 1-week trend filter (EMA34) and volume confirmation reduces whipsaws in choppy markets while capturing strong trends. The weekly trend filter ensures we only trade in the direction of the higher timeframe momentum, improving win rate in both bull and bear regimes. Volume confirmation ensures breakouts have conviction. Target: 30-100 total trades over 4 years (7-25/year) with improved Sharpe via better trend alignment.
