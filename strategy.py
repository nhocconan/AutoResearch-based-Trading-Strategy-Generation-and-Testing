"""
Hypothesis: 12h strategy using 1d Camarilla pivot R3/S3 levels breakout with volume confirmation and ATR trailing stop.
Long when price breaks above 1d Camarilla R3 level AND volume > 1.5x 20-period average.
Short when price breaks below 1d Camarilla S3 level AND volume > 1.5x 20-period average.
Exit when price retraces to the 1d Camarilla midpoint (R3-S3/2) or ATR trailing stop hit (2.5*ATR from highest/lowest since entry).
Uses discrete position sizing (0.25) to control drawdown and fee churn.
Designed for 12h timeframe to target 12-37 trades/year per symbol (50-150 total over 4 years).
Camarilla pivots identify key intraday support/resistance levels derived from prior day's range.
Breakouts above R3 or below S3 with volume confirmation indicate strong institutional interest.
Works in both bull and bear markets by capturing strong directional moves while avoiding false breakouts.
