# Hypothesis: 1d Williams Fractal breakout with 1w trend filter and volume confirmation
# Williams Fractals identify potential reversal points. A break above a bearish fractal
# or below a bullish fractal with volume and weekly trend continuation captures
# momentum in both bull and bear markets. Weekly trend filter avoids counter-trend trades.
# Target: 15-25 trades/year on 1d timeframe to minimize fee drag.
