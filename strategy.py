# 12h_WilliamsFractal_1dTrend_Volume_Confirm
# Hypothesis: Uses daily Williams Fractals (bearish = potential resistance, bullish = potential support)
# filtered by 1d EMA34 trend and volume spikes on 12h timeframe. In trending markets,
# price breaking above/below fractal levels with volume confirms momentum. Works in both bull
# and bear via trend-following fractal breaks. Designed for 12h to balance trade frequency
# and signal quality with minimal whipsaws.
