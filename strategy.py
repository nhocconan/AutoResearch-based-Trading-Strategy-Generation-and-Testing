# 4h_camarilla_breakout_volume_v1
# Hypothesis: 4h strategy using daily Camarilla pivot levels with volume confirmation.
# Long when price breaks above daily R4 with volume > 1.5x 20-period average.
# Short when price breaks below daily S4 with volume > 1.5x 20-period average.
# Exit when price closes back inside daily R3/S3 levels.
# Uses discrete position sizing (0.25) to minimize fee churn.
# Designed to capture strong breakouts in both bull and bear markets while avoiding false signals.
# Target: 20-50 trades/year (80-200 total over 4 years) on BTC/ETH/SOL.
