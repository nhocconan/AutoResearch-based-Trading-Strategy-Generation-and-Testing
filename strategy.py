# Hypothesis: 4h Camarilla R3/S3 breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume confirmation.
# Camarilla pivot levels identify key support/resistance where price often reverses or breaks out.
# Breakout above R3 or below S3 with volume confirmation and 1d EMA34 trend alignment captures strong moves.
# Works in both bull and bear markets by following institutional interest confirmed by volume.
# Target: 75-200 total trades over 4 years (19-50/year) to stay within fee drag limits.
