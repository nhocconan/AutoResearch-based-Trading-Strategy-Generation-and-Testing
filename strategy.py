Experiment #2875: 6h Camarilla Pivot Fade with 1d Volume Spike and Weekly Trend Filter
HYPOTHESIS: Camarilla pivot levels (R3/S3, R4/S4) from daily data act as strong reversal points.
We fade touches of R3/S3 when weekly trend is aligned (price > weekly EMA20 for longs, < for shorts).
Volume spike (>2.0x 20-period average) confirms institutional interest at these levels.
Weekly EMA20 filter ensures we only trade in the direction of the higher timeframe trend,
reducing false signals in choppy markets. 6h timeframe provides sufficient resolution for
entry timing while keeping trade frequency manageable (target: 75-150 trades over 4 years).
