12h_Camarilla_H3L3_Breakout_1dEMA34_Trend_VolumeSpike
Hypothesis: Trade Camarilla H3/L3 breakouts on 12h timeframe with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume spike confirmation.
Uses H3/L3 levels (less extreme than R3/S3) for more frequent but still high-quality signals.
1d EMA34 provides medium-term trend filter that adapts faster than EMA200 to regime changes.
Volume spike (>2.0x 20-period average) confirms breakout strength.
Only trade in direction of 1d trend to avoid counter-trend whipsaws.
Discrete sizing 0.25 to balance risk and minimize fee churn.
Target: 12-37 trades/year (50-150 total over 4 years) to stay within fee drag limits.
Works in both bull and bear markets by following the 1d trend direction.
