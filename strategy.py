12h Camarilla H3/L3 Breakout + 1d EMA34 Trend + Volume Spike
Hypothesis: Camarilla pivot levels (H3/L3) act as strong intraday support/resistance. 
Breakouts above H3 or below L3 with 1d EMA34 trend alignment and volume confirmation 
capture momentum moves in both bull and bear markets. 12h timeframe reduces noise 
and fee drag while allowing sufficient trades. Discrete sizing (0.30) limits churn.
