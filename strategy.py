# Hypothesis: 1d Camarilla R3/S3 breakout with 1w trend filter and volume confirmation
# Long when price breaks above Camarilla R3 level with 1w bullish trend (close > EMA50) and volume > 1.8x 20-period volume EMA
# Short when price breaks below Camarilla S3 level with 1w bearish trend (close < EMA50) and volume > 1.8x 20-period volume EMA
# Uses 1w EMA50 for major trend filter to reduce whipsaw, targeting 15-40 trades/year on 1d.
# Volume spike filter (1.8x) is tight to avoid overtrading. Camarilla levels provide institutional structure.
# Works in bull markets via longs in bullish 1w trend regime and bear markets via shorts in bearish 1w trend regime.
