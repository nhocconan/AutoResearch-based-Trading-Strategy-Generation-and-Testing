4h Camarilla H3/L3 Breakout with 1d EMA34 Trend Filter and Volume Spike
Hypothesis: Camarilla H3/L3 levels act as strong support/resistance derived from prior 1d price action.
Breakouts above H3 or below L3, when aligned with 1d EMA34 trend and confirmed by volume spikes,
capture institutional momentum while avoiding false signals. Designed for 4h timeframe to target
19-50 trades/year (75-200 over 4 years) by requiring confluence of Camarilla breakout, 1d EMA trend,
and volume confirmation. Works in bull/bear regimes via trend filter and volume spike requirement.
