# Hypothesis: 4h Camarilla R1/S1 breakout with daily trend filter and volume confirmation
# - Uses previous day's OHLC to calculate Camarilla R1 (resistance) and S1 (support) levels
# - Enters long when price breaks above R1 in daily uptrend (EMA34 rising) with volume spike (2x average)
# - Enters short when price breaks below S1 in daily downtrend (EMA34 falling) with volume spike
# - Exits when price returns to S1/R1 or daily trend reverses
# - Camarilla levels provide mathematically derived support/resistance based on prior day's range
# - Daily EMA34 trend filter ensures alignment with higher timeframe trend
# - Volume confirmation (2x 20-period average) filters out low-confidence breakouts
# - Position size 0.25 balances profit potential with risk management
# - Target: 20-50 trades per year to stay within fee drag limits
# - Works in both bull (breakouts in uptrend) and bear (breakdowns in downtrend) markets
# - Avoids overtrading by requiring multiple confluence factors (level break + trend + volume)
