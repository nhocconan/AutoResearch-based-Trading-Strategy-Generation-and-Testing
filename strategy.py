# Hypothesis: 6h Williams Fractal breakout with 1d trend filter and volume confirmation.
# Uses Williams Fractal (1d) to identify potential reversal points, enters on breakout of the
# fractal level in the direction of the 1d trend (EMA50). Volume filter ensures breakout
# has participation. Designed for low trade frequency (~15-25/year) to minimize fee drag.
# Williams Fractals work well in ranging markets while trend filter avoids counter-trend trades.
