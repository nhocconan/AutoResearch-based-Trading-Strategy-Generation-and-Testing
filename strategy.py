"""
12h Williams Fractal Breakout with Daily EMA Trend and Volume Spike
Hypothesis: Williams fractals identify significant swing highs/lows. Breakouts above recent bullish fractal highs or below bearish fractal lows, 
aligned with daily EMA trend and volume spike, capture strong momentum moves. 12h timeframe targets 12-37 trades/year, minimizing fee drag. 
Works in bull/bear markets by trading with the daily trend filter.
