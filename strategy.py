4h_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_1dWilliamsFractal_TrendAlign_v1
Hypothesis: 4h Camarilla R1/S1 breakout with 1d Williams Bearish/Bullish fractal confirmation and EMA20 trend alignment. Only takes long when price breaks above R1 with bullish fractal confirmation and price above EMA20, or short when price breaks below S1 with bearish fractal confirmation and price below EMA20. Uses ATR stop (2.5x) and minimum holding period of 4 bars. Designed for 4h timeframe with HTF fractal regime filter to work in both bull and bear markets by requiring confluence of HTF structure and LTF breakout. Target: 75-150 total trades over 4 years (19-38/year) to minimize fee drag.
