# Hypothesis: 12h Camarilla R3/S3 breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume confirmation.
# Long when price breaks above R3 and close > 1d EMA34 with volume > 1.5x 20-bar average.
# Short when price breaks below S3 and close < 1d EMA34 with volume > 1.5x 20-bar average.
# Uses discrete sizing 0.25 to target 12-37 trades/year on 12h timeframe.
# Camarilla R3/S3 act as strong breakout levels; combined with daily trend and volume spike filters.
# Works in bull markets via breakouts and in bear markets via mean-reversion at extreme levels.
