# Hypothesis: 1d_1w_camarilla_breakout_v1
# Weekly Camarilla pivot levels with daily price action and volume confirmation.
# Works in bull markets by capturing breakouts above weekly H3 resistance,
# and in bear markets by shorting breakdowns below weekly L3 support.
# Uses volume spike to confirm institutional participation and avoids overtrading
# by requiring weekly level breaks (lower frequency than daily levels).
# Target: 15-25 trades/year per symbol for low friction.
