# Hypothesis: 1d Donchian(20) breakout with 1w EMA34 trend filter and volume confirmation (>1.5x 20 EMA volume)
# Uses 1d Donchian channel breakouts for structure - captures strong momentum
# 1w EMA34 ensures alignment with higher timeframe trend to avoid counter-trend whipsaws
# Volume confirmation filters false breakouts (>1.5x average volume) - tighter to reduce trades to target
# Discrete sizing 0.25 minimizes fee churn while maintaining profitability
# Target: 50-100 total trades over 4 years = 12-25/year for 1d timeframe
# Works in bull markets (continuation at upper channel) and bear markets (continuation at lower channel)
# Focus on BTC/ETH by requiring 1w trend alignment (avoids SOL-only bias)
