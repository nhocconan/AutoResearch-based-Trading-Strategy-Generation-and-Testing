# Hypothesis: 1d Camarilla R3/S3 breakout with 1w EMA50 trend filter and volume spike confirmation
# Long when price breaks above R3 (strong resistance turned support) with volume spike AND 1w EMA50 uptrend
# Short when price breaks below S3 (strong support turned resistance) with volume spike AND 1w EMA50 downtrend
# Uses proven Camarilla pivot structure from DB winners with tight entry conditions to avoid overtrading
# Target: 30-100 total trades over 4 years (7-25/year) to minimize fee drag while capturing strong breakouts
