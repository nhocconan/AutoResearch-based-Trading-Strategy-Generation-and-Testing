"""
Hypothesis: 4h Camarilla R1/S1 Breakout with 1d EMA34 Trend Filter and Volume Spike.
- Long when price breaks above Camarilla R1 level AND close > 1d EMA34 AND volume > 2.0 * 20-period average
- Short when price breaks below Camarilla S1 level AND close < 1d EMA34 AND volume > 2.0 * 20-period average
- Exit when price returns to Camarilla H3/L3 levels (mean reversion) OR volume drops below average
- Uses 4h primary with 1d HTF for EMA trend filter to avoid counter-trend trades
- Camarilla levels calculated from previous day's OHLC; EMA34 filters for higher timeframe trend; volume spike confirms breakout conviction
- Designed to work in both bull (breakouts with volume) and bear (breakdowns with volume) markets
- Signal size: 0.25 discrete levels to minimize fee churn
- Target: 75-200 total trades over 4 years (19-50/year)
