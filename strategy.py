Experiment #2535: 6h Donchian(20) breakout + weekly pivot direction + volume confirmation
HYPOTHESIS: Combining 6h Donchian breakouts with weekly pivot bias and volume confirmation 
captures institutional participation during trend acceleration. Weekly pivot provides 
macro trend filter (1w timeframe), while Donchian breakouts with volume spikes capture 
momentum surges. Works in both bull/bear markets: long when price > weekly pivot + breakout, 
short when price < weekly pivot + breakdown. Discrete sizing (0.25) limits fee drag, 
targeting 75-150 total trades over 4 years.
