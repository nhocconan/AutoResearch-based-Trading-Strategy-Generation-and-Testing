4h Donchian(20) Breakout with 1d EMA34 Trend Filter and Volume Spike
Hypothesis: Donchian(20) breakouts capture strong momentum. When aligned with 1d EMA34 trend and confirmed by volume spikes,
this filters false breakouts and works in both bull (long breakouts) and bear (short breakouts) regimes.
Designed for 4h timeframe to target 20-50 trades/year (75-200 over 4 years) by requiring confluence of
Donchian breakout, 1d EMA34 trend, and volume confirmation, reducing overtrading and fee drag.
