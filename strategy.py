# 12h_PreviousDayCloseBreakout_VolumeTrend
# Hypothesis: Breakout above previous day's high or below previous day's low on 12h timeframe,
# confirmed by 1d EMA trend and volume spike (>2x 20-period average). Enter long when price
# breaks above prior day's high with uptrend, short when breaks below prior day's low with downtrend.
# Exit when price crosses back below/above the 1d EMA. Uses previous day's levels to avoid look-ahead.
# Targets 15-25 trades/year on 12h to minimize fee drag and work in both bull/bear via trend filter.
