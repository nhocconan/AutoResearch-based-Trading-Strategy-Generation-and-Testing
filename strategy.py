"""
Hypothesis: 4h Camarilla H3/L3 breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume spike confirmation.
- Camarilla H3/L3 levels provide high-probability breakout zones from 1d pivot structure.
- 1d EMA34 ensures alignment with daily trend to avoid counter-trend whipsaws.
- Volume > 2.0x 24-period average confirms breakout validity (tighter than 1.5x to reduce trades).
- Discrete position size 0.25 limits drawdown during crashes.
- Target: 20-40 trades/year on 4h timeframe (80-160 total over 4 years) to stay within fee-efficient range.
- Designed to work in both bull and bear regimes via trend filter and volume confirmation.
