12h_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_1dTrend_VolumeConfirm
Hypothesis: 12h Camarilla R1/S1 breakout confirmed by 1d EMA34 trend and volume spikes (>1.8x 20-bar avg). 
Enters long when price breaks above R1 with volume spike in 1d uptrend (close > EMA34), short when price breaks below S1 with volume spike in 1d downtrend (close < EMA34). 
Uses 12h primary timeframe for lower trade frequency (~20-40/year) and 1d HTF for trend stability. 
Designed to work in both bull and bear markets via trend filter and volume confirmation to avoid false breakouts.
