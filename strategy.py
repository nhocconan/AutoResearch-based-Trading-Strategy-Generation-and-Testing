# Hypothesis: 4h Camarilla R3/S3 breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume spike (>2.0x 20-bar avg) for confirmation.
# Uses 1d EMA34 for trend alignment (HTF), 4h Camarilla R3/S3 levels for breakout entry, and volume confirmation to avoid false breakouts.
# Designed for moderate trade frequency (target 75-200 total over 4 years) to minimize fee drag while capturing strong trends.
# Works in both bull and bear markets by following the 1d trend direction and requiring volume confirmation.
