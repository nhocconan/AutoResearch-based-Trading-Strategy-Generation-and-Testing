# Hypothesis: 1d Donchian(20) breakout with 1w trend filter and volume confirmation
# Long when price breaks above 20-day Donchian upper band AND weekly bullish trend (close > weekly EMA34) AND volume > 1.5x 20-day volume EMA
# Short when price breaks below 20-day Donchian lower band AND weekly bearish trend (close < weekly EMA34) AND volume > 1.5x 20-day volume EMA
# Uses weekly EMA34 for trend filter to reduce whipsaw in bear markets, targeting 15-25 trades/year on 1d.
# Volume confirmation and trend filter reduce noise trades. Donchian provides clear structure.
# Works in bull markets via longs in bullish weekly trend regime and bear markets via shorts in bearish weekly trend regime.
