# Hypothesis: 4-hour Donchian Breakout with Volume Confirmation and ATR Stoploss.
# Uses 4-hour Donchian channels (20-period high/low) with volume filter (current volume > 1.5x 20-period average).
# Go long on breakout above upper band, short on breakdown below lower band.
# Volume confirmation ensures breakouts have conviction. Works in both bull and bear markets
# by capturing breakouts in trending periods and avoiding false signals in chop.
# Target: 100-200 trades over 4 years (25-50/year).
