# Hypothesis: 12h Camarilla R3/S3 breakout with 1d EMA34 trend and volume spike
# Uses proven Camarilla levels (R3/S3) for high-probability breakouts in both bull/bear markets.
# Requires alignment with daily EMA34 trend and volume spike to filter false signals.
# Designed for low-frequency trades (<100 total) to minimize fee drag on 12h timeframe.
