# Hypothesis: 4h Camarilla R3/S3 breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume spike confirmation.
# Long when price breaks above Camarilla R3 AND close > 1d EMA34 AND 1d volume > 2.0 * 20-period average volume.
# Short when price breaks below Camarilla S3 AND close < 1d EMA34 AND 1d volume > 2.0 * 20-period average volume.
# Exit when price crosses 1d EMA34 in opposite direction.
# Uses discrete position sizing (0.25) to limit fee churn. Designed for BTC/ETH robustness by capturing institutional breakouts with volume confirmation and trend alignment.
# Target: 100-180 total trades over 4 years (25-45/year) for 4h timeframe.
