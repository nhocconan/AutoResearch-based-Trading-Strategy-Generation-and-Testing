"""
Hypothesis: 12h Donchian(20) breakout with 1d EMA50 trend filter and volume spike confirmation.
- Primary timeframe: 12h for lower trade frequency (~20-50 trades/year) and better signal quality.
- HTF: 1d EMA50 for trend direction (bullish if close > EMA50, bearish if close < EMA50).
- Volume: Current 12h volume > 2.0 * 20-period volume MA to capture institutional interest.
- Donchian: Upper/lower bands from 20-period high/low on 12h chart.
- Entry: Long when price breaks above Upper band AND 1d EMA50 bullish AND volume spike.
         Short when price breaks below Lower band AND 1d EMA50 bearish AND volume spike.
- Exit: Price reverts to midpoint of Donchian channel or loss of volume confirmation.
- Signal size: 0.25 discrete to balance return and drawdown.
- Target: 50-150 total trades over 4 years (12-37/year) for 12h timeframe.
This strategy combines institutional volume confirmation with Donchian breakouts,
filtered by daily trend to avoid counter-trend trades. Works in both bull and bear markets
by only taking trades in the direction of the 1d trend, with volume spikes confirming
participation. Donchian channels provide clear breakout levels with mean reversion exits.
