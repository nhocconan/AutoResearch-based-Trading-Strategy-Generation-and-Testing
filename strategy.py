4h_Camarilla_R1S1_Breakout_1dTrend_VolumeSpike
Hypothesis: Camarilla R1/S1 breakouts on 4h with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume spike (>2x 20-bar average).
R1/S1 represent inner Camarilla levels - breakouts with trend and strong volume have high continuation probability.
Uses discrete position sizing (0.25) to minimize fee churn. Target: 20-50 trades/year.
Works in bull markets (breakouts with trend) and bear markets (breakouts against trend via short signals).
