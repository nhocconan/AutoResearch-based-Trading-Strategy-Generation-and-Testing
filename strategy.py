4h_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_1dTrend_VolumeFilter
Hypothesis: Camarilla pivot levels on 1d timeframe (R1/S1) act as strong support/resistance. 
Breakouts above R1 or below S1 with volume confirmation and aligned 1d trend (close > EMA34) 
signal momentum continuation. This strategy uses 0.25 position size to balance risk/return 
and limit trade frequency (~20-40/year) to minimize fee drag in 4-hour bars. 
Works in bull markets via breakout continuation and in bear markets via breakdown continuation.
