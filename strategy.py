Experiment #5465: 12h Donchian(20) breakout + 1d volume confirmation + ATR stoploss
HYPOTHESIS: On 12h timeframe, price breaking above/below the 20-period Donchian channel with 
volume > 1.5x average volume on the daily timeframe captures strong momentum moves. 
This strategy targets fewer trades (12-37/year) by using higher timeframe (12h) for signals 
and daily volume for confirmation, reducing fee drift. Discrete position sizing (0.25) and 
ATR-based stoploss (2.0x ATR) control risk. Works in bull markets via breakouts above rising 
channels and in bear markets via short breakdowns below falling channels.
