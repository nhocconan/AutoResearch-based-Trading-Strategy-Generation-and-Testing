# Hypothesis: 12h Camarilla R3/S3 breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume confirmation.
# Long when price breaks above R3 with volume > 1.8x average AND price > 1d EMA34.
# Short when price breaks below S3 with volume > 1.8x average AND price < 1d EMA34.
# Exit on opposite Camarilla level (S3 for longs, R3 for shorts) or trend reversal.
# Uses discrete position sizing (0.25) to minimize fee churn. Target: 12-37 trades/year.
# Works in bull markets via breakout continuation and in bear markets via faded rallies at resistance.
# BTC/ETH edge: 1d EMA34 filters counter-trend breakouts; volume spike confirms institutional interest.
