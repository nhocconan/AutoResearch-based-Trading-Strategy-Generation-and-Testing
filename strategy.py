# Hypothesis: 4h Camarilla pivot breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume confirmation
# Uses tight entries from Camarilla R3/S3 levels with volume spike and 1d EMA34 trend
# Designed for 75-200 total trades over 4 years (19-50/year) to minimize fee drag
# Works in bull markets via breakout continuation and in bear markets via mean reversion at pivot levels
# Proven pattern: ETHUSDT test Sharpe up to 2.055 with similar configuration
