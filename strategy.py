# Hypothesis: 4h Donchian channel breakout with 1d volume confirmation and ATR trailing stop
# - Uses 20-period Donchian channels on 4h for breakout entries
# - Requires 1d volume > 1.5 * 20-day volume average for confirmation (regime filter)
# - Uses ATR(14) trailing stop (2.5 * ATR) and fixed position size 0.25
# - Works in bull markets via upside breakouts, in bear via downside breakdowns
# - Target: ~25 trades/year on 4h (100 total over 4 years) to minimize fee drag
# - Donchian channels provide adaptive volatility-based support/resistance
