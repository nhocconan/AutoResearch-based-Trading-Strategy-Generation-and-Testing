# Solution: The original strategy had 161-165 trades per symbol (too many) with near-zero Sharpe.
# Hypothesis: Overtrading due to too frequent entries on every volume spike above 1.5x MA.
# Fix: Reduce trades by requiring BOTH volume confirmation AND price to close outside
#        the prior day's range (not just touch S4/R4). This makes entry rarer and more meaningful.
#        Also tighten volume threshold to 2.0x MA and add a minimum price move filter.
#        Target: 20-50 trades per symbol (aligned with 12h sweet spot).
