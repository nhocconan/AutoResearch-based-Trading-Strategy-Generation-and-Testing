6h_1d_Williams_Fractal_Breakout_v1
Hypothesis: Williams fractal breakouts on 6h timeframe with 1d trend filter. 
Fractals confirm support/resistance strength - price breaking above/below recent fractal levels 
indicates momentum. Works in both bull/bear markets by only taking breakouts aligned with 1d EMA trend.
Target: 50-150 total trades over 4 years (12-37/year) with strict entry conditions.
