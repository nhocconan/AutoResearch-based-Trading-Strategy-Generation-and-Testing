12h_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_1dTrend_Volume
Hypothesis: 12h breakouts at daily Camarilla R1/S1 levels with daily trend filter and volume confirmation.
Targets 12-37 trades/year by requiring breaks beyond first support/resistance levels (indicating strong momentum),
alignment with daily trend, and volume surge. Works in bull/bear markets by trading with daily trend direction.
Uses 12h primary timeframe to reduce trade frequency and fee drag, with 1d HTF for trend and levels.
