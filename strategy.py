# Hypothesis: Camarilla R1/S1 breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume confirmation on 12h timeframe.
# Long when price breaks above R1 in uptrend with volume confirmation.
# Short when price breaks below S1 in downtrend with volume confirmation.
# Uses 12h timeframe to balance trade frequency and capture meaningful trends.
# Target: 50-150 total trades over 4 years (12-37/year) as per experiment guidelines.
# Works in bull markets (breakouts in uptrend) and bear markets (breakdowns in downtrend).
# Based on top-performing pattern from DB: Camarilla pivot + volume + trend filter.
