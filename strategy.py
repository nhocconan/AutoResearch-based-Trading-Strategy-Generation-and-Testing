12h_Pivot_R1S1_Breakout_WeeklyTrend_Volume
Hypothesis: 12-hour breakout from daily (1d) Camarilla R1/S1 levels, filtered by weekly (1w) EMA trend and volume confirmation.
Trades breakouts from key daily pivot levels only when aligned with weekly trend and accompanied by volume spike,
reducing false breakouts in ranging conditions. Designed for low frequency (12-37 trades/year) with strong performance
across market regimes by combining short-term structure (daily) with long-term trend (weekly).
