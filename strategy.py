# Hypothesis: 4h Camarilla R3/S3 breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume confirmation.
# Long when price breaks above R3 AND 1d EMA34 rising AND volume > 2.0x 20-bar average.
# Short when price breaks below S3 AND 1d EMA34 falling AND volume > 2.0x 20-bar average.
# Uses discrete sizing 0.25 to minimize fee churn. Designed for 4h timeframe to balance trade frequency and edge.
# Camarilla levels provide intraday support/resistance that adapt to volatility.
# 1d EMA34 trend filter ensures alignment with higher timeframe momentum.
# Volume spike requirement reduces false breakouts and improves signal quality.
# Target: 75-200 total trades over 4 years (19-50/year) for BTC/ETH/SOL.
