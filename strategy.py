# 4h_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_Volume
# Hypothesis: Camarilla pivot levels (R1/S1) from daily timeframe provide institutional support/resistance.
# Breakouts above R1 or below S1 with volume confirmation capture momentum in trending markets.
# Works in both bull and bear markets as it follows institutional order flow at key levels.
# Target: 20-40 trades/year (80-160 total over 4 years) to minimize fee drag.
