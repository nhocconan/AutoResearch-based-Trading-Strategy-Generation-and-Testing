"""
6h Williams Fractal Breakout with Daily EMA34 Trend and Volume Spike
Hypothesis: Williams fractals identify significant swing points. Breakouts above recent bearish fractals (resistance) 
or below recent bullish fractals (support) with volume confirmation and aligned daily EMA34 trend capture 
continuation moves. The daily EMA34 ensures we trade with higher timeframe momentum, reducing false breakouts. 
Volume spike confirms participation. Designed for low trade frequency (12-37/year) on 6h timeframe.
