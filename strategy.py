# Hypothesis: 4h Camarilla R3/S3 breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume spike confirmation.
# Long when price breaks above Camarilla R3 with 1d uptrend (close > 1d EMA34) and volume > 2.0x 20-bar avg.
# Short when price breaks below Camarilla S3 with 1d downtrend (close < 1d EMA34) and volume > 2.0x 20-bar avg.
# Exit on mean reversion to Camarilla pivot (PP) level.
# Uses proven Camarilla structure with strict volume confirmation (2.0x) to limit trades (target 20-50/year).
# 4h timeframe balances trend capture and fee minimization; 1d EMA34 ensures alignment with daily trend.
# This strategy targets both bull and bear markets by using trend filter and mean-reversion exits.
