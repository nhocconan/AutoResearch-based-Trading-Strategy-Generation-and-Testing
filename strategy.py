12h_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_1dTrend_VolumeSpike_v1
Hypothesis: 12h Camarilla R1/S1 breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume spike filter.
- Long when price breaks above Camarilla R1 AND 1d EMA34 uptrend AND volume > 1.5 * volume_ma(20)
- Short when price breaks below Camarilla S1 AND 1d EMA34 downtrend AND volume > 1.5 * volume_ma(20)
- Uses Camarilla pivot levels from completed 1d bars for structure-based breakouts
- 1d EMA34 filter ensures trading with higher timeframe trend to avoid counter-trend whipsaws
- Volume spike filter confirms institutional participation and reduces false breakouts
- Designed for low frequency (target 12-37 trades/year) to minimize fee drag
- Exit on opposite Camarilla level (S1 for longs, R1 for shorts) or trend reversal
- Works in both bull and bear markets by trading with the 1d trend and requiring volume confirmation
