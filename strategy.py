# Hypothesis: 12h Camarilla R3/S3 breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume spike confirmation
# Uses Camarilla pivot levels from 1d HTF for precise entry/exit zones
# 1d EMA34 provides strong trend filter to avoid counter-trend trades in ranging markets
# Volume > 2.0x average confirms institutional participation and reduces false breakouts
# Discrete position sizing (0.25) with Camarilla H3/L3 exit for quick profit taking
# Designed for ~12-25 trades/year to minimize fee drag while capturing strong moves
# Works in bull/bear via trend filter - only trades in direction of 1d EMA34
