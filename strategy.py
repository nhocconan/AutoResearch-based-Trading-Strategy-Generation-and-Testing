# Hypothesis: 4h Williams Fractal breakout with 1d EMA50 trend filter and volume confirmation.
# Long when price breaks above bearish fractal resistance AND price > EMA50(1d) AND volume > 1.5x 20-period average.
# Short when price breaks below bullish fractal support AND price < EMA50(1d) AND volume > 1.5x 20-period average.
# Exit when price crosses back below fractal resistance (for long) or above fractal support (for short).
# Williams Fractals identify key swing points. EMA50 filters trend direction. Volume confirms participation.
# Target: 80-120 total trades over 4 years (20-30/year).
