# Hypothesis: 6h Weekly Pivot Breakout with Daily Trend Filter and Volume Confirmation
# Uses weekly pivot points (R1/S1, R2/S2, R3/S3) as key support/resistance levels
# Daily EMA (20) provides trend filter to trade breakouts in direction of higher timeframe trend
# Volume confirmation (>1.5x average) ensures institutional participation
# Designed to work in both bull and bear markets by trading breakouts in direction of daily trend
# Target: 12-37 trades/year (50-150 total over 4 years) to minimize fee drag
