"""
Hypothesis: 12h Camarilla R1/S1 breakout with 1d EMA50 trend filter and volume confirmation.
Long when price breaks above Camarilla R1 AND volume > 1.5x 20-period average AND price > 1d EMA50.
Short when price breaks below Camarilla S1 AND volume > 1.5x 20-period average AND price < 1d EMA50.
Exit when price crosses the 1d EMA50 in opposite direction.
Designed for low trade frequency (12-37/year) to minimize fee drag while capturing strong breakouts in both bull and bear markets.
Uses proven Camarilla pivot structure from DB top performers.
