# Hypothesis: 12h Williams Fractal breakout with 1d trend filter and volume confirmation
# Williams Fractals identify key swing high/low levels with confirmation delay
# 1d EMA50 ensures we only trade in the direction of the higher timeframe trend
# Volume confirmation requires 1.5x average volume to ensure strong participation
# Target: 12-25 trades/year (50-100 total over 4 years) to minimize fee drag on 12h timeframe
# Works in both bull and bear markets by following the 1d trend direction and using fractal breakouts
