Hypothesis: 12h Camarilla H3/L3 breakout with 1d EMA50 trend filter and volume spike confirmation.
- Primary timeframe: 12h targeting 50-150 total trades over 4 years (12-37/year).
- HTF: 1d EMA50 for trend direction (bullish if close > EMA50, bearish if close < EMA50).
- Camarilla pivot levels: Calculated from prior 1d OHLC (H3, L3 levels for breakout).
- Entry: Long when price breaks above prior 1d H3 AND 1d EMA50 bullish AND volume > 2.0 * volume MA(20).
         Short when price breaks below prior 1d L3 AND 1d EMA50 bearish AND volume > 2.0 * volume MA(20).
- Exit: Close-based reversal - exit long when price crosses below prior 1d L3,
        exit short when price crosses above prior 1d H3.
- Signal size: 0.25 discrete to balance profit potential and drawdown control.
Designed to work in both bull and bear markets via trend filter and mean-reversion exits.
Proven pattern from DB: 12h_Camarilla_H3L3_1dEMA34_Trend_VolumeSpike_v1 achieved test Sharpe=0.116 with 65 trades/symbol.
Increasing EMA period to 50 for stronger trend filter should improve BTC/ETH performance.
