Experiment #1691: 6h Camarilla Pivot Breakout + 1d Volume Spike + ATR Stoploss
HYPOTHESIS: 6h Camarilla pivot levels (R3/S3 for mean reversion, R4/S4 for breakout) combined with 1d volume confirmation capture institutional order flow. In bull/bear markets, price often accelerates through R4/S4 on volume spikes, while R3/S3 offer high-probability mean reversion in ranging conditions. The 6h timeframe balances signal quality with reasonable trade frequency (~20-50 trades/year). Position size 0.25 manages drawdown during 2022-like crashes.
