# Hypothesis: 4h Daily Pivot S3/R3 breakout with 1d trend and volume confirmation
# - Daily Pivot S3/R3 act as strong support/resistance levels from prior day
# - Breakout above S3 with volume in daily uptrend = long opportunity
# - Breakdown below R3 with volume in daily downtrend = short opportunity
# - Volume spike (2.0x average) confirms institutional participation
# - Works in both bull (buy S3 breaks in uptrend) and bear (sell R3 breaks in downtrend)
# - Exit when price returns to S3/R3 or volume weakens
# - Position size 0.25 targets ~25-50 trades/year, avoiding fee drag
# - Uses actual daily Pivot levels (not weekly) for better relevance
# - Daily trend filter reduces whipsaws vs using same timeframe
# - Designed to work in BOTH bull and bear markets via trend filter
# - Volume confirmation reduces false breakouts
# - Novel combination: Daily Pivot S3/R3 (1d) + trend (1d) + volume (4h) not recently tried
# - Aims for 100-200 total trades over 4 years (25-50/year) to stay within limits
