# Hypothesis: 12h Williams Fractal breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume confirmation.
# Long when price breaks above recent bullish fractal high with 1d EMA34 uptrend and volume > 1.8x 20-bar average.
# Short when price breaks below recent bearish fractal low with 1d EMA34 downtrend and volume confirmation.
# Uses discrete sizing 0.25. ATR-based stoploss (signal→0 when price moves against position by 2.0*ATR).
# Primary timeframe: 12h, HTF: 1d for EMA trend and fractal confirmation.
# Target: 50-150 total trades over 4 years (12-37/year) to balance edge and fee drag.
# Session filter: 08-20 UTC to reduce noise trades.
