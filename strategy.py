# Hypothesis: 4h Camarilla R3/S3 breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume confirmation
# Long when price breaks above R3 (Camarilla resistance level 3) AND price > 1d EMA34 (uptrend) AND volume > 1.5 * 20-period avg volume
# Short when price breaks below S3 (Camarilla support level 3) AND price < 1d EMA34 (downtrend) AND volume > 1.5 * 20-period avg volume
# Exit with ATR-based trailing stop: signal→0 when long and price < highest_high - 2.0 * ATR OR short and price > lowest_low + 2.0 * ATR
# Uses discrete sizing 0.25 to balance risk and return (BTC -77% in 2022 → ~19.3% loss at 0.25 exposure)
# Target: 75-200 total trades over 4 years (19-50/year) for 4h timeframe
# Camarilla R3/S3 are stronger intraday levels than R1/S1, reducing false breakouts
# 1d EMA34 filters primary trend, volume confirmation ensures breakout momentum
# Moderate volume threshold (1.5x) and tighter ATR stop (2.0x) balance frequency and reliability
