# Hypothesis: 4h strategy using 1d Williams Fractal breakouts with volume confirmation.
# Long when price breaks above the most recent bullish fractal (high) with volume > 1.5x median.
# Short when price breaks below the most recent bearish fractal (low) with volume > 1.5x median.
# Uses discrete position size 0.25. Exits on opposite fractal break or ATR stoploss (2.0x ATR).
# Williams Fractals identify key swing points; breakouts with volume filter false moves.
# Works in both bull/bear markets by trading volatility expansion around structural levels.
# 4h timeframe targets 19-50 trades/year (75-200 total over 4 years) to minimize fee drag.
