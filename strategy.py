# Hypothesis: 4-hour Donchian breakout with 1-day trend filter and volume confirmation.
# Uses Donchian channels for breakout entries in trending markets, with 1-day EMA for trend direction.
# Volume confirmation ensures institutional participation. Designed for 4h to target 75-200 trades over 4 years.
# Works in both bull and bear markets by following the trend direction from higher timeframe.
