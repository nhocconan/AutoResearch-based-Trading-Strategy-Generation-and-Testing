12h_Camarilla_R1S1_Breakout_1dTrend_VolumeSpike
Hypothesis: 12h Camarilla R1/S1 breakout with 1-day EMA34 trend filter and volume confirmation.
Long when price breaks above R1 in 1d uptrend with volume spike.
Short when price breaks below S1 in 1d downtrend with volume spike.
Camarilla levels provide precise intraday support/resistance that work in both bull and bear markets.
Volume confirmation reduces false signals. Target: 12-37 trades/year on 12h timeframe.
