12h_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_1dTrend_VolumeSpike
Hypothesis: Camarilla R1/S1 breakout on 12h with volume spike (>2x 20-median) and 1d EMA34 trend filter.
Trading on 12h timeframe reduces trade frequency to avoid fee drag while capturing multi-day trends.
The 1d EMA34 filter ensures we only trade in the direction of the daily trend, avoiding counter-trend whipsaws.
Volume spike confirms institutional interest in the breakout direction.
Discrete sizing (0.25) minimizes fee drag. Target: 50-150 total trades over 4 years.
Works in bull via breakout continuation and in bear by avoiding counter-trend trades via daily EMA filter.
