# Hypothesis: 6h Williams Fractal Breakout with Weekly Trend and Volume Confirmation
# - Uses daily Williams fractals to identify potential reversal points
# - Breakout above bearish fractal with weekly uptrend or below bullish fractal with weekly downtrend
# - Volume spike confirms breakout strength
# - Weekly trend filter avoids counter-trend trades in both bull and bear markets
# - Target: 15-30 trades/year to minimize fee drag on 6h timeframe
# - Williams fractals require 2-bar confirmation delay for proper alignment
