# Hypothesis: 1d Donchian(20) breakout with 1w EMA200 trend filter and volume confirmation
# Long when price breaks above Donchian upper AND price > 1w EMA200 AND volume > 2.0x 20-bar avg
# Short when price breaks below Donchian lower AND price < 1w EMA200 AND volume > 2.0x 20-bar avg
# Exit when price retests Donchian midpoint (mean reversion within the channel)
# Uses discrete position sizing (0.25) to reduce fee drag and improve test generalization.
# Target: 10-25 trades/year on 1d timeframe (40-100 total over 4 years) to avoid overtrading.
# Focuses on strong breakouts with HTF trend filter and volume confirmation to capture high-probability moves
# while minimizing false signals in choppy markets. Works in bull markets by capturing breakouts
# and in bear markets by shorting breakdowns with trend alignment preventing counter-trend trades.
