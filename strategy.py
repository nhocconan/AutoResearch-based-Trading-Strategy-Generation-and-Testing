4h_Camarilla_R1_S1_Breakout_1dTrend_VolumeSpike_v2
Hypothesis: 4h Camarilla R1/S1 breakout with 1d trend filter (price >/< EMA34) and volume confirmation (>1.8x 20-bar avg). 
Enters long when price breaks above R1 in 1d uptrend with volume spike, short when breaks below S1 in 1d downtrend with volume spike. 
Exits on opposite Camarilla level touch (S1 for longs, R1 for shorts) or trend reversal. 
Reduced position size to 0.20 to lower fee drag and improve trade frequency (~20-40 trades/year).
Designed for 4h timeframe with strict entry conditions for better generalization.
