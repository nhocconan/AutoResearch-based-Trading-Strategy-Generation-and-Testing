12h_1d_Camarilla_R1S1_Breakout_Volume
Hypothesis: Breakout above/below 1d Camarilla R1/S1 levels on 12h timeframe with volume confirmation.
Trades only when price breaks the prior day's R1 (long) or S1 (short) with volume > 1.5x 20-period average.
Works in bull markets by capturing breakouts above daily resistance, and in bear markets by shorting breakdowns below daily support.
Volume filter reduces false breakouts. Targets 15-25 trades/year to stay within 50-150 total over 4 years.
