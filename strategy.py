12h_Camarilla_R3_S3_Breakout_1dEMA34_Trend_VolumeSpike_Dyn
Hypothesis: Camarilla R3/S3 breakout on 12h timeframe with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume spike (>2x 20-period MA). 
Long when price breaks above R3 with 1d uptrend and volume spike. 
Short when price breaks below S3 with 1d downtrend and volume spike. 
Uses discrete position sizing (0.25) to minimize fee churn. 
Designed to capture strong momentum moves in both bull and bear markets by aligning with 1d trend.
Target: 12-37 trades/year (50-150 total over 4 years).
