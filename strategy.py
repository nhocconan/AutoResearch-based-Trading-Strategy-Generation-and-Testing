# 4h_1D_Camarilla_R3_S3_Breakout_1dTrend_VolumeSpike
# Hypothesis: 4-hour breakouts from daily Camarilla R3/S3 levels with daily EMA34 trend filter and volume spike confirmation.
# In uptrend (price > EMA34), long breakouts above R3 are favored; in downtrend (price < EMA34), short breakdowns below S3 are favored.
# Volume spike ensures institutional participation, reducing false breakouts.
# Targets 20-40 trades per year by requiring confluence of daily trend, daily level break, and volume spike.
