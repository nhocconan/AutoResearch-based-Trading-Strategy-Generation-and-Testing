# Hypothesis: 12h strategy using daily Williams Fractal breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume spike confirmation
# Long when price breaks above the most recent daily bullish fractal AND price > 1d EMA34 AND volume > 1.8 * avg_volume(20) on 12h
# Short when price breaks below the most recent daily bearish fractal AND price < 1d EMA34 AND volume > 1.8 * avg_volume(20) on 12h
# Exit when price crosses back below/above the 1d EMA34 OR volume drops below average
# Uses discrete sizing 0.25 to balance return and risk
# Target: 60-120 total trades over 4 years (15-30/year) for 12h timeframe
# Daily Williams Fractals provide robust swing high/low levels from higher timeframe
# 1d EMA34 filters primary trend to avoid counter-trend trades
# Volume spike confirms breakout strength and reduces false signals
# Works in bull markets (breakouts with uptrend) and bear markets (breakdowns with downtrend)
