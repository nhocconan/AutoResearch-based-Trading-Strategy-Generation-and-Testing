# Hypothesis: 4h Donchian(20) breakout with 1d EMA(50) trend filter and volume confirmation
# - Uses 1d EMA(50) for trend direction (long when price > EMA, short when price < EMA)
# - Uses 4h Donchian(20) channels for breakout entries (long at upper band, short at lower band)
# - Requires volume > 1.3 * 20-period volume average for confirmation (slightly relaxed from 1.5 to increase trades)
# - Fixed position size 0.25 to manage drawdown and reduce fee churn
# - ATR(14) stoploss at 2.5 * ATR from entry extreme
# - Works in bull markets via breakouts above resistance, in bear via breakdowns below support
# - Target: 20-50 trades/year on 4h timeframe (80-200 total over 4 years)
