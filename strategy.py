# Hypothesis: 12h Camarilla pivot breakout with 1d volume confirmation and trend filter
# - Long when price breaks above Camarilla H3 level with volume > 1.3x average AND daily close > daily EMA50
# - Short when price breaks below Camarilla L3 level with volume > 1.3x average AND daily close < daily EMA50
# - Exit when price retreats to Camarilla H4/L4 levels or volume drops below average
# - Daily trend filter ensures alignment with major trend across market cycles
# - Volume confirmation prevents false breakouts
# - Targets 12-37 trades/year (50-150 total over 4 years) to avoid fee drag on 12h timeframe
# - Camarilla pivots work well in ranging markets; combined with daily trend/volume filters for breakouts
# - Uses proper MTF data loading to avoid look-ahead and excessive I/O
