12h_1d_Camarilla_R1S1_Breakout_Volume
Hypothesis: Breakout above/below daily Camarilla R1/S1 levels on 12h timeframe with volume confirmation. 
Works in bull markets by buying breakouts above R1, and in bear markets by selling breakouts below S1. 
Uses volume > 1.5x 20-period average for confirmation. Targets 12-37 trades/year on 12h timeframe.
