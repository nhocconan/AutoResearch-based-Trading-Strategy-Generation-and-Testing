# 1d_Camarilla_R3_S3_Breakout_1wTrend_Volume
# Hypothesis: 1-day breakouts from weekly-based Camarilla R3/S3 levels with volume spike confirmation and weekly trend filter.
# Uses 1d timeframe to reduce trade frequency (<30 trades/year) while leveraging weekly structure for trend direction.
# Works in bull/bear markets: weekly trend filter ensures trades align with higher timeframe momentum,
# volume confirmation avoids false breakouts, and Camarilla R3/S3 provide statistically significant levels.
# Target: 20-40 total trades over 4 years (5-10/year) to minimize fee drag.
