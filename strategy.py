# Hypothesis: 6h Williams Fractal breakout with weekly EMA34 trend filter and volume confirmation
# Uses weekly EMA34 for trend filter (very long-term trend) and 6h Williams fractals for breakout signals
# Entry logic: Long when price breaks above recent 6h bearish fractal with volume spike and price > weekly EMA34
#              Short when price breaks below recent 6h bullish fractal with volume spike and price < weekly EMA34
# Exit logic: Exit when price crosses the weekly EMA34 (trend reversal) or opposite fractal level
# Works in both bull and bear markets by trading with the weekly trend
# Target: 50-150 total trades over 4 years (12-37/year) for 6h timeframe
# Discrete sizing 0.25 balances profit potential and fee drag
