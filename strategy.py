# Hypothesis: 4h Williams Fractal breakout with 1d EMA34 trend filter and volume spike confirmation
# Long when price breaks above recent Williams bearish fractal (resistance) AND price > EMA34(1d) AND volume > 2.0x 20-period average
# Short when price breaks below recent Williams bullish fractal (support) AND price < EMA34(1d) AND volume > 2.0x 20-period average
# Exit when price crosses back below/above the opposite fractal level OR trend flips (price crosses EMA34(1d))
# Williams Fractals identify swing points: bearish fractal = high with 2 lower highs on each side, bullish = low with 2 higher lows
# Using 1d timeframe for fractals provides significant swing levels; requires 2-bar confirmation delay
# 1d EMA34 provides higher timeframe trend filter to avoid counter-trend whipsaws
# Volume spike confirms institutional participation
# Target: 19-50 trades/year per symbol (75-200 total over 4 years) for 4h timeframe
# Discrete sizing (0.25) to limit fee drag
