# Hypothesis: Further increasing the volume threshold to 2.5x average and extending cooldown to 8 bars (16 hours)
# will reduce trade frequency to target 15-25 trades per year, minimizing fee drag while maintaining
# the edge of Camarilla R3/S3 breakouts with 1d EMA34 trend confirmation. This should improve
# generalization to the test period (2025-2026) by focusing only on the strongest institutional breakouts.
# Position size reduced to 0.25 to manage drawdown during volatile periods. Works in both bull (breakouts above R3)
# and bear (breakdowns below S3) markets by trading with the higher timeframe trend.
